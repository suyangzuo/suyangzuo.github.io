Forms are the primary way users send data to the server, and client-side validation improves usability by providing immediate feedback. The input element fires events such as input, change, blur, and focus. JavaScript can intercept the submit event with preventDefault to block submission until validation passes. Common checks include required fields, email patterns, numeric ranges, and password confirmation. The Constraint Validation API exposes properties like validity.valueMissing, tooShort, rangeOverflow, and methods such as setCustomValidity(message) to display custom error messages. For complex rules, regular expressions or external libraries like Yup or Joi can be used. Accessibility requires associating labels with inputs using for and id attributes, and announcing errors via ARIA live regions. Debounce or throttle events to avoid excessive validation calls. Remember that client-side validation is not a security measure; always re-validate on the server. Progressive enhancement starts with semantic HTML attributes like required, pattern, and type, then layers JavaScript on top for richer feedback.
