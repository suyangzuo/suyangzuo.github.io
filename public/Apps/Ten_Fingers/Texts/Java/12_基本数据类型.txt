Java defines eight primitive data types that are not objects and are stored directly on the stack for efficiency. These include byte, short, int, and long for integer numbers of different sizes; float and double for floating-point numbers; char for a single Unicode character; and boolean for true/false values. For example, an int is a 32-bit integer, while a double is a double-precision 64-bit floating-point. All other data types in Java are reference types, which point to objects stored in the heap. This distinction between primitives and objects is a fundamental part of the language.
