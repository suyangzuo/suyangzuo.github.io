When regulators knock, scattered console logs are worth less than confetti. We rebuilt our Node.js audit system around immutable trails: every mutation - password reset, credit spent, consent toggled - emits a single "audit" event containing actor, tenant, delta, and ISO8601 timestamp. A dedicated logger streams these events to a separate Kafka topic with exactly-once semantics. Consumers batch write to AWS QLDB, a journal database that cryptographically verifies history, making tampering evident. Personal data is pseudonymized at origin: user emails are replaced with SHA-256 hmac using a rotating salt kept in AWS KMS, so deletion requests only need to forget the key, not rewrite terabytes. Access controls follow zero-trust; even SREs require break-glass tickets to query QLDB, and all queries are themselves logged. Retention is tiered: hot QLDB for ninety days, cold Glacier for seven years, with automatic expiration to satisfy GDPR storage-limitation. The first compliance audit passed in two hours instead of two weeks, and our lawyers now wave the cryptographic digest like a magic shield. Evidence beats intent - log like you are already in court.
