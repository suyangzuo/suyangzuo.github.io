The evolution of Java has accelerated significantly since Oracle moved to a rapid, time-driven release cycle. A new feature release now arrives every six months, ensuring a steady stream of innovations. Major recent versions have introduced transformative features. Java 8 brought lambdas and the Streams API. Later versions have added modules, local-variable type inference with var, new garbage collectors, and enhanced APIs. This modern release cadence keeps the language vibrant and competitive, allowing developers to benefit from new features more frequently while maintaining the stability and backward compatibility that enterprises rely on.
