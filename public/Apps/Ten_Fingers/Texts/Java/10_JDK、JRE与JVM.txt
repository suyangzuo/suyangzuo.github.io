Understanding the distinction between the JDK, JRE, and JVM is crucial for Java developers. The JVM is the engine that executes Java bytecode. The Java Runtime Environment is the on-disk software package that contains the JVM, class libraries, and other components needed to run Java applications. It is the package you would install on a computer to execute a Java program. The Java Development Kit is a superset of the JRE. It includes everything in the JRE, plus tools necessary for developing Java applications, most importantly the compiler and debugger. So, developers need the JDK, while end-users only need the JRE to run the compiled software.
