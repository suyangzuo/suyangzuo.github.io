Control flow statements are the decision-makers and automatons of a C program, directing the path of execution based on conditions and enabling repetitive tasks. The if statement is the most basic form of conditional branching, allowing the program to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true. It can be extended with else if and else clauses to handle multiple, mutually exclusive pathways. For scenarios requiring a multi-way branch based on the value of an integral expression, the switch statement provides a more structured and readable alternative to a long chain of if-else statements. For repetition, C offers several loop constructs. The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as its condition remains true, checking the condition before each iteration. The do-while loop is a slight variation that guarantees the loop body is executed at least once, as it checks the condition at the end. The for loop, often the most commonly used, consolidates initialization, condition checking, and increment/decrement into a single, compact header, making it ideal for iterating a specific number of times. These control mechanisms are the logical glue that transforms a static sequence of declarations into dynamic, intelligent, and powerful software.
