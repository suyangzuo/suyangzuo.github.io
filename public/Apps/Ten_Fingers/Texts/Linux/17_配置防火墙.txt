A firewall is a critical security tool that controls incoming and outgoing network traffic on Linux systems, blocking unauthorized access while allowing legitimate connections (like SSH or web traffic). UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a user-friendly front-end for the more complex iptables firewall, making it easy to set up and manage basic firewall rules - ideal for beginners and system administrators alike. This article covers how to enable UFW, configure essential rules, and verify firewall status.​
First, checking if UFW is installed and enabled is the starting step. Most Debian-based distributions (Ubuntu, Linux Mint) include UFW by default; if not, install it with sudo apt install ufw. For RHEL-based systems (Fedora, CentOS), UFW is available via sudo dnf install ufw but may require disabling the default firewalld first with sudo systemctl stop firewalld && sudo systemctl disable firewalld. To check UFW status, run sudo ufw status - it will show inactive if not enabled, or list active rules if running.​
Enabling UFW with default rules provides a basic level of security: sudo ufw enable turns on the firewall, with default policies to deny all incoming traffic (blocking unauthorized connections) and allow all outgoing traffic (letting your system access the internet). After enabling, sudo ufw status verbose shows detailed status, including default policies and active rules - this confirms the firewall is running and configured correctly.​
Configuring essential firewall rules lets you allow specific traffic. For example, to allow SSH connections (critical for remote server management), use sudo ufw allow ssh - UFW recognizes the "ssh" keyword and allows traffic on port 22 (the default SSH port). If SSH uses a non-default port (e.g., 2222), specify the port with sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp (TCP is the protocol used by SSH). To allow web traffic (HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443), use sudo ufw allow http and sudo ufw allow https, or combine them with sudo ufw allow 80/tcp && sudo ufw allow 443/tcp.​
Allowing traffic from a specific IP address (e.g., your home network) adds an extra layer of security. For example, sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.5 permits all incoming traffic from the IP 192.168.1.5 (your home computer), while sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 22 allows SSH access only from the local network 192.168.1.0/24 (subnet mask /24 covers all IPs from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254).​
Deleting or modifying rules is straightforward if you need to adjust access. First, list all rules with their numbers using sudo ufw status numbered - this shows each rule with a number (e.g., [1] 22/tcp ALLOW IN Anywhere). To delete a rule, use sudo ufw delete rule-number - e.g., sudo ufw delete 1 removes the first rule. To disable UFW temporarily (not recommended for production), use sudo ufw disable; to reset all rules to default (useful for starting over), run sudo ufw reset.​
Verifying firewall functionality ensures rules work as expected. For example, after allowing SSH, test remote access from another device to confirm you can still connect. Use sudo ufw status to double-check that allowed ports are listed and no unintended rules are present. Tools like nmap (install with sudo apt install nmap) can scan your system from another device: nmap your-server-ip shows which ports are open, confirming that only allowed ports (like 22, 80, 443) are accessible.​
Common UFW use cases include:​
Securing a web server (allow HTTP/HTTPS, block all other incoming traffic).​
Protecting a remote server (allow SSH only from trusted IPs).​
Securing a home computer (block all incoming traffic except for specific apps).​
In short, UFW simplifies Linux firewall management, making it easy to protect your system from unauthorized access. By enabling UFW, configuring essential rules for services like SSH and web traffic, and verifying status, you can significantly improve your system's security.
