Java simplifies memory management for developers by incorporating an automatic garbage collector. In languages like C++, programmers must manually allocate and deallocate memory, which can lead to errors such as memory leaks or dangling pointers. In Java, the programmer creates objects using the new keyword, and the JVM automatically handles their allocation on the heap. The garbage collector then runs in the background, monitoring the heap and identifying objects that are no longer referenced by any part of the program. It safely reclaims the memory occupied by these unreachable objects, preventing memory leaks and making application development more robust and less error-prone.
