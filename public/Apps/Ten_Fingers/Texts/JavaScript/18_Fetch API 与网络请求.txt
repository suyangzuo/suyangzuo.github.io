XMLHttpRequest has been superseded by the Fetch API, which returns Promises and supports streaming, Request/Response objects, and better error semantics. A basic call is fetch(url).then(res => res.json()).then(data => ...). The second argument is an options object that includes method, headers, body, mode, credentials, cache, redirect, referrer, and signal for cancellation. CORS restrictions apply; cross-origin requests require appropriate Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers from the server. To send JSON, stringify the body and set Content-Type to application/json. Error responses such as 404 or 500 do not reject the Promise; you must check res.ok or res.status manually. AbortController provides a way to cancel in-flight requests, useful when the user navigates away or types rapidly in a search box. For upload progress, use XMLHttpRequest or wrap fetch in a ReadableStream and read chunks. Always handle network failures and timeouts to avoid hanging UI. Polyfills like whatwg-fetch add support to older browsers, but modern development should prefer fetch for its cleaner API and streaming capabilities.
