Java Database Connectivity is an API that enables Java applications to connect to a wide range of relational databases. JDBC provides a standard set of interfaces for tasks like establishing a connection to a database, executing SQL statements, and processing the results. The database vendor provides a specific JDBC driver that implements these interfaces. This allows the programmer to write database-agnostic code. The typical workflow involves loading the driver, obtaining a Connection object, creating a Statement or PreparedStatement object, executing a query, and processing the returned ResultSet. JDBC is the foundation for most data access layers in Java enterprise applications.
