Accessibility (a11y) ensures Electron apps are usable by everyone - including users with visual, motor, or cognitive disabilities. Desktop apps are legally required to meet accessibility standards in many regions (e.g., ADA in the U.S., WCAG globally), and accessible apps reach a wider audience. Electron's integration with Chromium's accessibility features and native OS tools makes adaptation manageable with targeted changes.​
Start with UI accessibility basics in the renderer process. Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., <button> instead of <div> for clickable elements)  - semantic elements are automatically recognized by screen readers (e.g., NVDA on Windows, VoiceOver on macOS). Avoid using custom elements without adding accessibility attributes: if you use a <div> as a button, add role="button", tabindex="0", and keyboard event listeners (for Enter and Space keys) to ensure it's usable with keyboards and screen readers. For example: <div role="button" tabindex="0" id="custom-btn">Click Me</div> and in JavaScript: document.getElementById('custom-btn').addEventListener('keydown', (e) => { if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') { e.preventDefault(); handleClick(); } });.​
Add ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes to enhance screen reader support. ARIA attributes provide extra context for elements that lack semantic meaning. For example, label a text input with aria-label="Note Title" so screen readers announce it correctly: <input type="text" aria-label="Note Title" placeholder="Enter title">. Use aria-hidden="true" for decorative elements (e.g., icons that don't add meaning) to avoid cluttering screen reader output. For dynamic content (e.g., a notification that appears), use aria-live="polite" to tell screen readers to announce updates when idle: <div aria-live="polite" id="notification"></div>.​
Ensure keyboard navigation works for all features. Many users rely on keyboards instead of mice - test that every interactive element (buttons, menus, inputs) is reachable via the Tab key and usable with Enter/Space. Fix "focus traps" (elements that trap the Tab key, preventing navigation away) by ensuring modals and dialogs let users tab out or close with the Escape key. Use :focus-visible styles to highlight focused elements (e.g., a blue border around a focused button)  - this helps keyboard users track their position in the app.​
Test with screen readers and accessibility tools. On macOS, use VoiceOver (enable with Cmd+F5) to navigate the app - listen for accurate announcements of elements and actions. On Windows, use NVDA (free, open-source) with Firefox or Chrome. For automated testing, use tools like axe-core (install with npm install axe-core --save) in the renderer process - add axe.run() to your test suite to scan for accessibility issues (e.g., low contrast, missing labels). Electron's built-in accessibility module in the main process lets you enable debug logging: app.setAccessibilitySupportEnabled(true); to help identify issues.​
Adapt to OS accessibility settings. Respect user preferences like high contrast mode (common for users with visual impairments)  - use CSS media queries to adjust styles: @media (prefers-contrast: more) { .btn { background: black; color: white; border: 2px solid white; } }. For users with motor disabilities who use larger cursors or touch targets, ensure interactive elements are at least 48x48 pixels (WCAG standard)  - avoid small buttons that are hard to click or tap.​
Best practices: Include accessibility in the design phase, not as an afterthought. Train your team on WCAG 2.1 AA standards (the minimum for most legal requirements). Document accessibility features (e.g., keyboard shortcuts, screen reader support) in your app's help section. Get feedback from users with disabilities - their insights will catch issues tools might miss.​
In short, accessibility is essential for inclusive Electron apps. By using semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and testing tools, you can build apps that work for everyone - expanding your audience and meeting legal requirements.
