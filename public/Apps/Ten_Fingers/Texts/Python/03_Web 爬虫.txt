Web scraping with Python is a powerful technique for automatically extracting data from websites. The classic combination of the requests library and BeautifulSoup makes this process accessible.
First, requests is used to fetch the raw HTML content of a webpage. A simple response = requests.get('https://example.com') retrieves the data. It's crucial to check response.status_code to ensure the request was successful (a 200 code). Once you have the HTML, it's often a complex string of text. BeautifulSoup parses this HTML into a structured tree of Python objects, making it easy to navigate and search.
You can find elements by their tag name (e.g., all <p> paragraphs), CSS class, or ID. For instance, soup.find_all('div', class_='product-name') would find all <div> tags with a specific class. After locating the elements, you can extract the text or attribute values. Responsible scraping is paramount: always respect robots.txt, avoid overwhelming servers with rapid requests, and be aware that scraping copyrighted data may have legal implications. For modern websites that load data dynamically with JavaScript, tools like Selenium or Playwright are necessary, as they can control a real web browser to execute the JavaScript and access the fully rendered page.
