In Vue 3, components usually render their content inside their parent component's DOM tree - but sometimes you need to render content in a different part of the DOM (like modals or tooltips that should overlay the entire app). The Teleport component solves this by letting you "teleport" a component's content to any DOM element, while keeping the component's logic tied to its parent. This article explains how Teleport works and common use cases for it.​
The core idea of Teleport is simple: it takes a to prop that specifies the target DOM element (using a CSS selector, like #app-overlays), and wraps the content you want to teleport. For example, if you have a Modal component that's used inside a ProductList component, you can use Teleport to="#app-overlays" inside the Modal's template. When the Modal renders, its content will be moved to the #app-overlays element in the DOM - even though the Modal is a child of ProductList in the component hierarchy.​
One of the biggest benefits of Teleport is avoiding CSS issues. Modals or tooltips often need to use position: fixed to overlay the entire app, but if their parent component has overflow: hidden or a z-index that's too low, the content can get clipped or hidden. By teleporting to a top-level DOM element (like one outside the main app container), you ensure the content renders correctly without fighting parent component styles.​
Teleport also keeps component logic connected to the parent. Even though the content is rendered elsewhere, the component's props, events, and reactive state still work as if it were in the parent's DOM tree. For example, if the Modal has a isOpen prop controlled by the ProductList component, toggling isOpen in ProductList will still show/hide the Modal - and the Modal can emit events (like close) that the ProductList listens to, just like any other child component.​
Common use cases for Teleport include modals, tooltips, notifications, and dropdowns. For example, a notification system that shows alerts across the app can teleport each notification to a top-level #notifications container, ensuring all notifications stack correctly and are visible above other content.​
Using Teleport is straightforward, but there are a few things to note. The target DOM element (specified in to) must exist in the DOM before the Teleport component renders - otherwise, the content will stay in the parent's DOM. You can check if the target exists using document.querySelector() and conditionally render the Teleport if it does. Also, Teleport doesn't create a new component instance - it just moves the content's DOM nodes, so the component's lifecycle hooks (like mounted) still run when the parent component mounts.​
In summary, Vue 3's Teleport component is a flexible tool for controlling where content renders in the DOM. It solves common CSS issues with overlay components while keeping component logic connected to the parent, making it essential for building modals, tooltips, and other overlay-based UI elements.
