For Vue apps targeting global users, internationalization (i18n) is a must - it lets you adapt your app's content to different languages and regions without rebuilding the entire app. This article covers the key steps to add i18n to Vue apps, from choosing a library to dynamic language switching and regional formatting.​
The most popular i18n library for Vue is vue-i18n, maintained by the Vue team. It works seamlessly with both Vue 2 and Vue 3, supporting features like language files, dynamic translations, and regional formatting for dates, numbers, and currencies. To start, install vue-i18n via npm - for Vue 3, use npm install vue-i18n@next. Then, configure it in your app: create a i18n instance with a default language (like English) and load translation files for other languages (like Spanish or French).​
Translation files are usually stored in a locales folder, with one file per language (e.g., en.json for English, es.json for Spanish). These files are JSON objects where keys are the same across all languages, and values are the translated text. For example, en.json might have "welcome": "Welcome to our app", while es.json has "welcome": "Bienvenido a nuestra aplicación". In your Vue components, use the $t function (Options API) or useI18n hook (Composition API) to access these translations - like $t('welcome') in templates.​
Dynamic language switching is another key feature. Add a dropdown or buttons in your app to let users select their preferred language. When a user selects a language, call the locale method from vue-i18n to update the app's active language - for example, i18n.locale = 'es' to switch to Spanish. The app will automatically update all translated text without reloading the page, thanks to Vue's reactivity.​
Regional formatting is often overlooked but important for user experience. vue-i18n includes tools to format dates, numbers, and currencies based on the active locale. For example, formatting a date as $d(new Date(), 'long') will show "January 1, 2024" in English (en-US) and "1 de enero de 2024" in Spanish (es-ES). Similarly, formatting a number as $n(1000, 'currency') will show "$1,000.00" in en-US and "1.000,00 €" in German (de-DE) if the currency is set to EUR.​
Testing i18n is simple: switch between languages to ensure all text is translated (no hardcoded strings left) and that regional formats work as expected. Use tools like vue-i18n-extract to scan your app for missing translations, which helps avoid incomplete language support.​
In short, vue-i18n makes Vue app internationalization straightforward. By using translation files, dynamic language switching, and regional formatting, you can create an app that feels native to users around the world.
