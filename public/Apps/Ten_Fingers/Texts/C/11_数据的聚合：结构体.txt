Structures, or structs, are user-defined data types that allow the grouping of variables of different types under a single name. While an array is a collection of identical items, a structure is a collection of potentially dissimilar items that collectively describe a logical entity. For example, to represent a student, you could create a struct Student containing a string (or array of chars) for the name, an integer for the ID, and a float for the GPA. The variables inside a structure are called its members. Structures provide a way to organize related data in a meaningful and coherent manner, making code more readable and maintainable. Once a structure type is defined, you can declare variables of that type. Members of a structure variable are accessed using the dot . operator. If you have a pointer to a structure, you use the arrow -> operator to access its members. Structures are fundamental for creating complex data models, from graphics points and rectangles to database records and linked list nodes, forming the basis for representing real-world objects in code.
