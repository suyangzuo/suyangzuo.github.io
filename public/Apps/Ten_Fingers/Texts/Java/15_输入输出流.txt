Java uses the concept of streams to handle input and output operations. A stream is a sequence of data. The java.io package provides classes for reading and writing data using byte streams and character streams. Byte streams, with classes like InputStream and OutputStream, are used for handling raw binary data. Character streams, with classes like Reader and Writer, are designed for handling text, automatically handling character encoding. The NIO package provides an alternative I/O mechanism with features like non-blocking I/O and buffers, which can be more efficient for some applications. These I/O capabilities are fundamental for reading files, network communication, and data serialization.
