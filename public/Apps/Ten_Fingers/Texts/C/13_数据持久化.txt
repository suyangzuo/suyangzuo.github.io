File Input/Output (I/O) operations in C enable programs to interact with the external world by reading from and writing to files on a storage device. The standard library, primarily through stdio.h, provides a comprehensive set of functions for this purpose. The process typically begins with the fopen function, which opens a file and returns a pointer to a FILE object, a structure that contains information about the file. The fopen function requires a filename and a mode string, such as "r" for reading, "w" for writing (which creates a new file or truncates an existing one), or "a" for appending. Once a file is open, you can use functions like fprintf and fputc to write data, and fscanf and fgetc to read data. For reading and writing blocks of binary data, the fread and fwrite functions are most efficient. It is absolutely critical to close an open file using fclose once operations are complete. This ensures that all data is properly written from internal buffers to the disk and that the system resources associated with the file are freed. Proper file handling is essential for creating programs that can persist data beyond a single execution.
