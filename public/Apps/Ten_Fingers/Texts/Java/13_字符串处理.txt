In Java, strings are represented by the String class, which is one of the most commonly used classes. Strings are immutable objects, meaning their value cannot be changed after they are created. Operations that appear to modify a string, like concatenation, actually create a new String object. The Java API provides a rich set of methods for string manipulation, including length(), charAt(), substring(), indexOf(), and equals(). For efficient string modification, Java offers the StringBuilder and StringBuffer classes, which are mutable sequences of characters. Understanding how to work with strings effectively is essential for almost any Java application.
