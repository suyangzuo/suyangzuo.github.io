Linux is known for its powerful command-line interface (CLI), which lets users control the system efficiently - whether managing files, configuring settings, or creating users. For beginners, learning essential Linux commands is the first step to mastering the system, as it avoids the limitations of graphical tools and works across all Linux distributions (like Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian). This article breaks down the most useful basic Linux commands, how to use them, and common scenarios where they shine.​
File and directory management is the foundation of Linux CLI use. The ls command is one of the most frequently used - it lists the contents of the current directory. Adding options to ls expands its functionality: ls -l shows detailed information (like file permissions, size, and modification time), ls -a displays hidden files (those starting with a dot), and ls -h formats file sizes in human-readable units (like KB or MB) instead of raw bytes. For example, running ls -lh in your home directory will show all files and folders with clear size labels, making it easy to identify large files.​
Navigating between directories uses the cd command (short for "change directory"). To move to a specific folder, type cd followed by the directory path - cd Documents takes you to the Documents folder inside your current directory, while cd /home/user/Documents uses an absolute path (starting from the root directory /) to reach the same folder. Two handy shortcuts with cd are cd ~ (takes you to your home directory, no matter where you are) and cd .. (moves up one directory level, like from Documents to your home folder).​
Creating and deleting files and directories is straightforward with touch, mkdir, and rm. The touch command creates empty files - touch notes.txt makes a new text file named notes.txt in the current directory. To create a directory, use mkdir (short for "make directory"): mkdir Projects creates a Projects folder. For deleting, rm (short for "remove") deletes files - rm old.txt deletes the old.txt file. To delete a directory, add the -r option (for "recursive") to delete the folder and all its contents: rm -r OldProjects removes the OldProjects directory and everything inside it. Note that rm is permanent on most Linux systems, so always double-check before using it.​
User and permission management is another key area. The sudo command (short for "superuser do") lets you run commands with administrative privileges - essential for tasks like installing software or modifying system files that regular users can't access. For example, sudo apt install firefox installs the Firefox browser on Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu. To create a new user, use sudo adduser newusername - this prompts you to set a password and add optional details (like the user's full name). To switch to another user account, use su newusername (short for "substitute user"), which logs you into that user's session.​
Checking system information is useful for troubleshooting or verifying settings. The uname command shows basic system details: uname -a displays the Linux kernel version, hostname, and hardware architecture (like 64-bit or 32-bit). The df command checks disk space - df -h shows how much space is used and available on each storage device (like your main hard drive or external USB), formatted in human-readable units. For checking memory usage, free -h displays how much RAM is in use, free, and cached, helping you identify if your system is running low on memory.​
In short, mastering these basic Linux commands lets you handle most daily tasks efficiently. Start with file management and navigation, then move to user and system checks - with practice, the CLI will become faster and more intuitive than graphical tools. Whether you're using Linux for personal use or server management, these commands are the building blocks of your Linux skills.
