A "process" is any program running on a Linux system - from simple commands (like ls) to background services (like Nginx). Monitoring processes helps you track resource usage (CPU, memory) and identify unresponsive or resource-hungry programs, while controlling processes lets you stop, restart, or prioritize them. Linux offers tools like ps, top, htop, and kill for process management. This article covers how to monitor processes, interpret key metrics, and control processes when needed.​
Monitoring processes starts with viewing running processes. The ps command (process status) is the most basic tool: ps aux lists all processes on the system, with columns showing the user running the process (USER), process ID (PID), CPU usage (%CPU), memory usage (%MEM), and the command (COMMAND). For example, a line like root      1234  0.5  2.3 123456 78901 ?        Ssl  10:00  0:05 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx means the nginx master process has PID 1234, uses 0.5% CPU and 2.3% memory, and is run by the root user. The ? in the TTY column indicates it's a background process (not attached to a terminal).​
For real-time process monitoring, top and htop are more useful than ps (which shows a snapshot). As covered earlier, top displays a dynamic, updating list of processes sorted by CPU usage by default. Key metrics to watch in top include: %CPU (percentage of CPU the process is using), %MEM (percentage of RAM), VSZ (virtual memory size, total memory the process can access), and RSS (resident set size, actual memory the process is using). Press P in top to sort by CPU usage, M to sort by memory, and q to quit. htop (a more user-friendly alternative) adds color coding, mouse support, and easier process selection - making it ideal for beginners.​
Finding a specific process (e.g., all nginx processes) uses ps aux | grep processname - the grep command filters the ps output. For example, ps aux | grep nginx lists all processes with "nginx" in their command name. Another tool for finding processes is pgrep, which returns only PIDs: pgrep nginx outputs the PIDs of all nginx processes, which is useful for scripting or quickly getting PIDs to control the process.​
Controlling processes involves stopping, restarting, or sending signals to them using the kill command (which sends a signal to a process by PID). The most common signal is SIGTERM (signal 15), a graceful shutdown signal that lets the process clean up before exiting: sudo kill 1234 sends SIGTERM to the process with PID 1234. If the process is unresponsive and doesn't exit with SIGTERM, use SIGKILL (signal 9), which force-kills the process immediately: sudo kill -9 1234 (note: SIGKILL doesn't let the process clean up, so use it only as a last resort).​
To stop all processes of a specific type (e.g., all nginx processes), use pkill processname - sudo pkill nginx sends SIGTERM to all nginx processes, while sudo pkill -9 nginx force-kills them. For services managed by systemd (like Nginx or MySQL), it's better to use systemctl stop servicename instead of kill - this ensures the service stops gracefully and follows systemd's shutdown procedures (e.g., saving state).​
Prioritizing processes (controlling how much CPU time they get) uses the nice and renice commands. The "nice value" ranges from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority) - default is 0. To start a process with a custom nice value, use nice -n value command - e.g., nice -n 10 ./slow-script.sh starts slow-script.sh with low priority (so it doesn't hog CPU). To change the nice value of a running process, use renice -n value PID - e.g., sudo renice -n 5 1234 lowers the priority of PID 1234 to 5.​
Common process management scenarios include stopping an unresponsive browser (find its PID with ps aux | grep firefox, then kill PID), killing a resource-hungry script (use kill -9 PID if it won't stop), or prioritizing a critical service (set its nice value to -5 with renice). Regularly monitoring processes helps you catch issues like memory leaks (a process's memory usage growing over time) or CPU spikes (a process using 100% CPU), which can slow down the entire system.​
In summary, Linux process monitoring and control tools let you keep track of running programs and manage them effectively. By mastering ps, top, kill, and nice, you can identify resource bottlenecks, stop unresponsive processes, and prioritize critical tasks - ensuring your Linux system runs smoothly.
