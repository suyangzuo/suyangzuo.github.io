Variables and data types form the very bedrock of data manipulation in C, acting as named containers for storing information in the computer's memory. C is a statically-typed language, meaning every variable must be explicitly declared with its data type before it can be used. This declaration informs the compiler about the amount of memory to allocate and how to interpret the stored bits. The primary fundamental data types include int for integers, float and double for floating-point numbers, and char for single characters. Each of these types has specific characteristics; for instance, an int typically represents whole numbers without fractional components, while a double offers greater precision and range compared to a float. The char type is used to store a single byte, often representing a character from the ASCII set. When a variable is declared, such as int counter; or double salary;, the compiler reserves a memory location of the appropriate size. The programmer can then assign values to these variables using the assignment operator =, like counter = 10;. This system of strongly-defined types is crucial for writing predictable, efficient, and error-free code, as it prevents ambiguous interpretations of data.
