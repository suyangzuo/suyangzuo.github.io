The Java Collections Framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections of objects. It includes interfaces like List, Set, and Map that define the fundamental operations for different types of collections. List represents an ordered collection, Set a collection with no duplicates, and Map an object that maps keys to values. The framework provides several implementations for these interfaces, such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, and HashMap. This framework provides high-performance, high-quality implementations of useful data structures and algorithms, reducing programming effort and increasing performance.
