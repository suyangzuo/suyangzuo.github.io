Remote access is a core feature of Linux, letting you manage servers or other Linux machines from a different device - whether you're working from home or managing a cloud server. The most common tool for remote Linux access is SSH (Secure Shell), which encrypts all data transferred between devices, ensuring security over public networks. This article covers SSH basics, how to connect to a remote Linux machine, and how to set up key-based authentication (a more secure alternative to passwords).​
SSH works by establishing an encrypted connection between a client (your local machine) and a server (the remote Linux machine). Most Linux distributions include the SSH client by default; if not, install it with sudo apt install openssh-client (Debian/Ubuntu) or sudo dnf install openssh-clients (Fedora/CentOS). The remote machine needs the SSH server installed and running - on the remote Linux machine, install the server with sudo apt install openssh-server (Debian/Ubuntu) or sudo dnf install openssh-server (Fedora/CentOS), then start the service with sudo systemctl start sshd (or ssh on some systems) and enable it to run on boot with sudo systemctl enable sshd.​
To connect to a remote machine via SSH, use the ssh command followed by the remote user's username and the machine's IP address or hostname: ssh username@remote-ip. For example, ssh alice@192.168.1.100 connects to the remote machine at IP 192.168.1.100 as the user alice. The first time you connect to a new machine, SSH will prompt you to verify the remote machine's fingerprint (a unique identifier) to ensure you're connecting to the correct device - type yes to confirm, and SSH will save the fingerprint for future connections. You'll then be prompted to enter the remote user's password; once entered, you'll have access to the remote machine's command line, just like you're sitting in front of it.​
By default, SSH uses port 22 for connections. If the remote machine's SSH server is configured to use a different port (a common security practice to avoid brute-force attacks), specify the port with the -p option: ssh -p 2222 alice@192.168.1.100 connects to port 2222 instead of the default 22. You can also run a single command on the remote machine without opening a full shell session: ssh alice@192.168.1.100 "ls -l /home/alice" runs the ls -l command on the remote machine and displays the output locally.​
Password-based SSH login is simple but less secure - passwords can be guessed or stolen via brute-force attacks. Key-based authentication is a more secure alternative: it uses a pair of cryptographic keys (a private key stored on your local machine, and a public key stored on the remote machine) to authenticate, eliminating the need for passwords. To set up key-based authentication, first generate a key pair on your local machine using ssh-keygen - run the command, and it will prompt you to choose a location to save the keys (default is ~/.ssh/id_rsa for the private key and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub for the public key) and an optional passphrase (a password to protect the private key, adding an extra layer of security). Press Enter to accept the defaults (or set a passphrase if you want added security).​
Next, copy the public key to the remote machine using ssh-copy-id: ssh-copy-id alice@192.168.1.100 - this automatically adds your local public key to the remote machine's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file (the file SSH checks for trusted public keys). You'll be prompted to enter the remote user's password one last time. After this, you can connect to the remote machine via SSH without entering a password: ssh alice@192.168.1.100 will authenticate using the key pair and log you in immediately.​
To enhance SSH security further, you can disable password-based login on the remote machine (so only key-based login is allowed). On the remote machine, edit the SSH configuration file /etc/ssh/sshd_config using a text editor like nano: sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config. Find the line PasswordAuthentication and set it to no (if the line is commented out with a #, remove the # first). Save the file (in nano, press Ctrl+O, then Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X). Restart the SSH server to apply the changes: sudo systemctl restart sshd. Now, only users with a valid public key in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys can connect to the remote machine - password login is disabled, preventing brute-force attacks.​
Common remote access scenarios include managing a cloud server (like an AWS EC2 instance), troubleshooting a home Linux machine from another room, or collaborating on a project with a remote team. When using SSH over public networks (like coffee shop Wi-Fi), always ensure key-based authentication is enabled and password login is disabled to protect your remote machine from unauthorized access.​
In summary, SSH is a secure, reliable tool for remote Linux access. By mastering basic SSH connections, setting up key-based authentication, and disabling password login, you can manage remote Linux machines safely and efficiently. Whether you're a system administrator or a casual Linux user, SSH is an essential skill for remote work and server management.
