The publish-subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern decouples producers of events from consumers, fostering modular architectures. In JavaScript, you can implement a minimal version in fewer than fifty lines: maintain a plain object whose keys are event names and whose values are arrays of listener functions. Expose three methods - subscribe, unsubscribe, and publish - and guard against edge cases such as duplicate listeners or missing topics. Add wildcard support, priority queues, or once-only callbacks to match real-world libraries like EventEmitter3. Use cases range from coordinating React components without prop-drilling to decoupling micro-front-ends. Writing your own Pub/Sub also illustrates higher-order functions, closures, and memory-leak prevention when listeners forget to unsubscribe. Once comfortable, compare your toy implementation to mature solutions to appreciate performance optimizations such as linked lists or WeakMap-based metadata. The exercise is small enough to fit in a blog post yet rich enough to teach architectural thinking.
