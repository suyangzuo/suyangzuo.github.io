Over time, Linux systems accumulate unnecessary files - like old log files, cached packages, unused applications, and large temporary files - that take up valuable disk space. Running out of disk space can cause slowdowns, prevent new software installations, or even crash services (like databases that need space to write data). Regular disk space cleanup keeps your system efficient and avoids these issues. This article covers how to identify space-hungry files/directories and safely delete unnecessary data.​
First, identifying disk space usage uses tools like df and du to understand where space is being used. The df command (disk free) shows overall disk usage for each mounted partition. Running df -h (with -h for human-readable units like GB/MB) displays total space, used space, free space, and usage percentage for each partition. For example, output like /dev/sda2  450Gi  400Gi  20Gi  96% / means the root partition (/) has 450 GB total, 400 GB used, only 20 GB free, and is 96% full - signaling an urgent need for cleanup.​
To find which specific files or directories are using the most space, use the du command (disk usage). Running du -sh /home/* ( -s for summary, -h for human-readable) shows the size of each subdirectory in /home - this helps you spot large folders (e.g., a Downloads folder with 50 GB of old files). For a more detailed, recursive scan (checking all subdirectories), use du -h /var - this lists the size of every folder in /var (a common location for large logs and caches). Adding the -max-depth=1 option (e.g., du -h --max-depth=1 /) limits the scan to top-level directories, making the output easier to parse.​
Cleaning up common space-hogging files starts with removing cached package files. Most Linux distributions cache downloaded software packages to avoid re-downloading them later, but these caches can grow large. For Debian-based systems (Ubuntu), use sudo apt clean to delete all cached package files (stored in /var/cache/apt/archives/). The sudo apt autoremove command removes unused dependencies - packages that were installed to support other software but are no longer needed (e.g., libraries for an app you uninstalled months ago). For RHEL-based systems (Fedora), use sudo dnf clean all to clear package caches and sudo dnf autoremove to delete unused dependencies.​
Old log files are another major source of wasted space. Linux automatically rotates logs (compresses old logs and deletes the oldest ones) via logrotate, but sometimes rotated logs (stored in /var/log/ with extensions like .1, .2.gz) accumulate. To safely delete old log files, first check their age with ls -lh /var/log/*.gz (to see when they were created), then delete logs older than a certain date (e.g., 30 days) with a command like sudo find /var/log -name "*.gz" -mtime +30 -delete ( -mtime +30 targets files modified more than 30 days ago). Avoid deleting active log files (like syslog or auth.log) - only delete rotated, compressed logs.​
Temporary files stored in /tmp and /var/tmp are designed to be short-lived, but they can sometimes persist. The /tmp directory is usually cleared on system reboot, but you can manually delete old files here with sudo find /tmp -mtime +7 -delete (removing files older than 7 days). The /var/tmp directory retains files longer, so use sudo find /var/tmp -mtime +30 -delete to clean it up. Always avoid deleting files in /tmp or /var/tmp that are currently in use (check with lsof /tmp/file-name if you're unsure - lsof lists open files).​
Unused applications and large user files (like old downloads, backups, or duplicate documents) are other targets for cleanup. Use sudo apt remove packagename (Debian) or sudo dnf remove packagename (RHEL) to uninstall apps you no longer use (e.g., old text editors or games). For user files, check your Downloads, Documents, and Pictures folders - delete duplicate files (use tools like fdupes if needed) or move large files to an external hard drive to free up space on your main disk.​
Common disk cleanup scenarios include:​
Freeing space to install a new app: If df -h shows low free space, run apt autoremove and apt clean (or equivalent for RHEL) to quickly reclaim space.​
Resolving a "disk full" error: Delete old logs and temporary files first, then uninstall unused apps or move large user files to external storage.​
Routine maintenance: Schedule a monthly cleanup (using Cron) to run apt autoremove, apt clean, and delete old logs - preventing space issues before they occur.​
In short, regular disk space cleanup is essential for Linux system health. By using df and du to identify space hogs, and safely deleting cached packages, old logs, temporary files, and unused apps, you can keep your system's storage efficient and avoid performance issues caused by low disk space.
