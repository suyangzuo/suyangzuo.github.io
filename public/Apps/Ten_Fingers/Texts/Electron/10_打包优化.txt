Electron apps are often criticized for being large - default packaging can result in 100MB+ files - but with targeted optimizations, you can significantly reduce size and improve load times. These optimizations focus on removing unnecessary files, compressing assets, and streamlining dependencies, ensuring your app is lean without losing functionality.​
Start with dependency cleanup. Use npm ls to identify unused packages, then remove them with npm uninstall packagename. Avoid including development dependencies in production: use npm prune --production to delete dev-only packages (like electron-debug or test tools) before packaging. For front-end dependencies (e.g., React, Vue), use tree shaking - tools like Webpack or Vite automatically remove unused code from libraries. For example, if you only use a few functions from a large utility library, tree shaking ensures the rest isn't included in the final build.​
Optimize asset files (images, CSS, JavaScript). Compress images with tools like TinyPNG (for PNG/JPG) or Squoosh (browser-based) to reduce file size without losing quality. Use SVG for icons and graphics - SVGs are vector-based, so they're smaller than bitmaps and scale without pixelation. Minify CSS and JavaScript files: Webpack, Vite, or standalone tools like Terser (for JS) and CSSNano (for CSS) remove whitespace, comments, and redundant code. For example, minifying a large CSS file can reduce its size by 30-50%.​
Configure packaging tools to exclude unnecessary files. If using Electron Builder, add an files field to package.json to specify exactly which files to include - e.g., "files": ["main.js", "renderer/", "assets/"] excludes logs, node_modules subfolders (like node_modules/.cache), and other non-essential files. Use the asar format (enabled by default in Electron Builder) to bundle your app's source code into a single archive - this reduces the number of files and slightly improves load times. Disable asar only if your app needs direct file system access to bundled files (rare for most apps).​
Trim Electron's built-in features. Electron includes Chromium and Node.js, but you can disable unused components. For example, if your app doesn't use WebGL or video playback, disable GPU acceleration with webPreferences: { hardwareAcceleration: false } in the BrowserWindow options - this reduces memory usage and may slightly shrink the app size. Avoid using Electron's remote module (deprecated) or other legacy APIs, as they add unnecessary overhead; use IPC instead for main-renderer communication.​
Use compression during packaging. Electron Builder supports ZIP compression for the app package - enable it with compression: 'maximum' in the build section of package.json. This reduces the final file size by 20-40% but may increase packaging time slightly. For Linux, use deb or rpm formats (which are compressed by default) instead of tar.gz for better size efficiency.​
Test size and load time after each optimization. Use du -sh (Linux/macOS) or dir /s (Windows) to check the packaged app's size. Measure load time by timing how long it takes for the main window to appear after launching the app - optimizations like dependency cleanup and asset compression should reduce this time by 10-30%.​
In summary, packaging optimization for Electron is about removing bloat and streamlining assets. By cleaning dependencies, compressing files, configuring packaging tools, and trimming unused features, you can build smaller, faster apps that users will appreciate - especially those with limited storage or slower devices.
