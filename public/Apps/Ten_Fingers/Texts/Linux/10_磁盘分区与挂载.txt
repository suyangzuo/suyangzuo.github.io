Managing storage on Linux involves partitioning disks (dividing a disk into logical sections) and mounting partitions (connecting them to the filesystem so the system can access files). Whether you're adding a new hard drive, SSD, or USB stick, understanding how to partition and mount storage devices is essential for expanding your system's storage or organizing data. This article covers how to identify storage devices, create partitions with fdisk, and mount partitions permanently.​
First, identify the storage devices connected to your system using lsblk (list block devices) or fdisk -l. lsblk displays a simple tree view of all disks and their partitions - for example, /dev/sda is often the main hard drive, with partitions like /dev/sda1 (boot partition) and /dev/sda2 (root partition). sudo fdisk -l provides more detailed information, including disk size, partition type, and filesystem (e.g., ext4, NTFS). When adding a new device (like a USB drive), it will appear as /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc (the next available letter), with partitions like /dev/sdb1.​
Creating partitions uses fdisk (for MBR disks) or gdisk (for GPT disks - modern, supports larger disks). MBR (Master Boot Record) is an older partition style that supports disks up to 2TB and 4 primary partitions; GPT (GUID Partition Table) is newer, supports disks larger than 2TB, and allows unlimited partitions (with a practical limit of 128). To create a partition on a new disk (e.g., /dev/sdb), run sudo fdisk /dev/sdb. The fdisk prompt lets you enter commands: n to create a new partition, p to select a primary partition (for MBR), then specify the start and end sectors (or use defaults to use the entire disk). After creating the partition, use w to write changes to the disk (this applies the partition and exits fdisk).​
Next, format the partition with a filesystem - Linux's most common filesystem is ext4 (stable, supports large files), while NTFS is used for compatibility with Windows. To format a partition (e.g., /dev/sdb1) with ext4, use sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1 - this erases all data on the partition, so ensure it's empty before proceeding. For NTFS, use sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdb1 (you may need to install ntfs-3g first with sudo apt install ntfs-3g or sudo dnf install ntfs-3g).​
Mounting a partition temporarily makes it accessible at a specific directory (mount point). First, create a mount point (a empty directory) with sudo mkdir /mnt/new-drive. Then mount the partition with sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/new-drive - now, files on /dev/sdb1 will be accessible under /mnt/new-drive. To unmount the partition (when you want to safely remove the device), use sudo umount /mnt/new-drive (do not unmount a partition that's in use - this can cause data loss).​
To mount a partition automatically on system boot (permanent mount), edit the /etc/fstab file (filesystem table). First, get the partition's UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) - this is more reliable than device paths (like /dev/sdb1, which can change if devices are added/removed) using blkid /dev/sdb1 - it will output something like UUID="abc123-def4-5678-90gh-ijklmnopqrst" TYPE="ext4". Open /etc/fstab with a text editor: sudo nano /etc/fstab, and add a line at the end: UUID=abc123-def4-5678-90gh-ijklmnopqrst /mnt/new-drive ext4 defaults 0 2. The fields break down as: UUID (partition identifier), mount point, filesystem type, mount options (defaults = read/write, auto-mount), dump (0 = no backup), pass (2 = check filesystem on boot, 0 = no check). Save and exit nano, then test the mount with sudo mount -a - this mounts all partitions in /etc/fstab and ensures there are no syntax errors.​
Common disk management scenarios include adding a new SSD for faster storage (partition, format as ext4, mount to /home to move user files), using a USB drive for backups (mount temporarily to /mnt/usb), or expanding storage with an external hard drive (permanent mount via /etc/fstab). Always unmount removable devices (like USB drives) before disconnecting them - use sudo umount /mnt/usb or the graphical "eject" option to avoid data corruption.​
In summary, partitioning and mounting are fundamental Linux storage skills. By using tools like lsblk, fdisk, and mount, and configuring fstab for permanent mounts, you can manage storage devices effectively, expand your system's capacity, and organize data securely. Whether you're a casual user or a system administrator, these skills are essential for working with Linux storage.
