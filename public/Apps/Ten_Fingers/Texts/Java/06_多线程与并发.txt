Java has built-in support for multithreaded programming from its inception. A thread is a lightweight sub-process that allows a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently. Java provides a simple way to create and manage threads, either by extending the Thread class or implementing the Runnable interface. This enables developers to build highly responsive and performant applications. For example, a graphical user interface can remain responsive to user input while performing a long-running calculation in a background thread. The Java language and its standard library also offer sophisticated synchronization mechanisms and high-level concurrency utilities in the java.util.concurrent package to help developers write correct and efficient multithreaded code.
