Linux systems run many background services (also called daemons) that handle essential tasks - like web servers (Apache, Nginx), database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL), or network services (SSH). Managing these services (starting, stopping, restarting) and configuring them to run automatically on boot is crucial for server stability and user convenience. Most modern Linux distributions use systemd (a system and service manager) for this, replacing older tools like sysvinit. This article covers systemd basics, how to manage services, and how to set up auto-start.​
To list all running services, use systemctl list-units --type=service. This shows active services, their status (running, stopped, failed), and a brief description. To check the status of a specific service (like SSH or Nginx), use systemctl status servicename - for example, systemctl status sshd for the SSH service. The output includes details like whether the service is running, its PID, and recent log entries (helpful for troubleshooting if the service fails to start).​
Starting, stopping, and restarting services uses systemctl start, systemctl stop, and systemctl restart commands. These require sudo privileges for system services. For example, sudo systemctl start nginx starts the Nginx web server. sudo systemctl stop mysql stops the MySQL database. sudo systemctl restart apache2 restarts the Apache web server (useful after making configuration changes, as most services need a restart to apply updates).​
Reloading a service (to apply configuration changes without stopping it) uses systemctl reload - this is preferred over restart when possible, as it avoids downtime. For example, sudo systemctl reload nginx applies new Nginx configs without interrupting active web traffic. Not all services support reloading, though - if reload fails, use restart instead.​
Enabling or disabling auto-start (so the service runs when the system boots or not) uses systemctl enable and systemctl disable. sudo systemctl enable sshd sets SSH to start on boot - this is useful for remote servers, so you can access them after a reboot. sudo systemctl disable nginx prevents Nginx from starting automatically (if you only need it occasionally). To check if a service is enabled, use systemctl is-enabled servicename - it will return enabled, disabled, or masked (masked means the service is blocked from starting, even manually).​
Troubleshooting failed services often involves checking logs. The journalctl command (part of systemd) lets you view service logs: sudo journalctl -u servicename shows all logs for the specified service. Adding -f (follow) keeps the log open, showing new entries in real time - sudo journalctl -u mysql -f is helpful for watching MySQL errors as they happen. Common issues include missing configuration files, incorrect permissions on service directories, or port conflicts (another service using the same port).​
For example, if Nginx fails to start, run systemctl status nginx to see the error - if it says "address already in use," another service (like Apache) is using port 80. Stop the conflicting service with sudo systemctl stop apache2 and then start Nginx again. If the error is a missing config file, check the Nginx config directory (/etc/nginx/) for missing files or typos.​
In summary, systemd is the standard tool for managing Linux services. By mastering systemctl commands for status, start/stop/restart, and auto-start, and using journalctl for logging, you can keep your system's services running smoothly. Whether you're running a web server, database, or network service, proper service management ensures your system is reliable and accessible when you need it.
