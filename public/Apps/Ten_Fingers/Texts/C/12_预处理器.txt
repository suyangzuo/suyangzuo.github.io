The C preprocessor is a powerful text substitution tool that processes the source code before it is compiled. It is not part of the compiler itself but a separate step in the compilation pipeline. Directives for the preprocessor begin with a # symbol. The most common directive is #include, which tells the preprocessor to open a specified file (like a header file) and insert its contents directly into the source code at that location. Another vital directive is #define, used to create macros. A macro can be a simple symbolic constant, like #define PI 3.14159, which replaces all subsequent instances of PI with that number before compilation. Macros can also be function-like, accepting arguments, though they require careful use due to potential side effects. Conditional compilation directives like #ifdef, #ifndef, #if, #else, and #endif allow certain blocks of code to be included or excluded based on defined conditions, which is invaluable for writing portable code that can be compiled in different environments. The preprocessor, while simple in concept, is a versatile tool for code configuration and management.
