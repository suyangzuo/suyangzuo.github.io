Dynamic memory management is a critical aspect of C that allows programs to acquire and release memory at runtime, rather than at compile time. This is essential when the amount of data a program needs to handle is not known in advance. The standard library provides four key functions for this purpose, declared in the stdlib.h header: malloc, calloc, realloc, and free. The malloc function (memory allocation) requests a block of memory of a specified size in bytes. It returns a pointer to the beginning of this block, which is typically cast to the appropriate pointer type. The calloc function (contiguous allocation) is similar but also initializes all the allocated memory to zero. The realloc function is used to resize a previously allocated block of memory, making it larger or smaller. The most crucial partner to any of these allocation functions is free. Any memory allocated with malloc, calloc, or realloc must be explicitly returned to the system by calling free with the original pointer. Failure to do so results in a memory leak, where memory is consumed but never freed, potentially leading to performance degradation and program failure. This manual memory management model gives C programmers ultimate control but also demands great discipline.
