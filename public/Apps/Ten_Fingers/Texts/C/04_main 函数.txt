At the very core of every C program lies the main function, the unequivocal entry point where execution begins. This function is the control center, the conductor of the program's orchestral score. The canonical first program for any budding C programmer is the "Hello, World!" example. This deceptively simple program involves including the standard input-output header file, stdio.h, which declares essential functions like printf. The main function is then defined, typically with a return type of int to indicate success or failure status to the operating system. Within the function's body, the printf function is called with a string literal argument enclosed in double quotes. The \n at the end of the string represents a newline character, moving the cursor to the next line after printing. Finally, the return 0; statement signifies a successful termination. This entire structure, while minimal, encapsulates the fundamental workflow of a C program: preparation, execution of instructions, and a formal conclusion. Understanding the role and structure of main is the first critical step in mastering the language's operational model.
