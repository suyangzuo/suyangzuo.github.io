Knowing how to check key system information - like hardware specs, OS version, or running services - helps you troubleshoot issues, verify configurations, and ensure your Linux system meets software requirements. Linux provides simple command-line tools to access this information, no graphical interface needed. This article covers the most useful commands for viewing OS details, hardware info, and resource status.​
Viewing the operating system version and distribution is the first step when troubleshooting or installing software (which often requires a specific OS version). For Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Linux Mint), use lsb_release -a - this outputs the distribution name (e.g., Ubuntu), release version (e.g., 22.04 LTS), and codename (e.g., Jammy Jellyfish). For RHEL-based systems (Fedora, CentOS), use cat /etc/os-release - this shows similar details in a key-value format (e.g., PRETTY_NAME="Fedora Linux 38 (Workstation Edition)"). To check the Linux kernel version (critical for driver compatibility), run uname -r - the output (e.g., 5.15.0-78-generic) shows the kernel release number.​
Checking hardware information helps you understand your system's capabilities (e.g., CPU cores, RAM size, storage type). For CPU details, lscpu is the most comprehensive tool - it displays the number of CPU cores (physical and logical), clock speed (e.g., 3.5 GHz), architecture (e.g., x86_64), and cache size. For example, CPU(s): 8 means 8 logical cores (4 physical cores with hyper-threading). To check RAM, free -h shows total, used, and free memory in human-readable units (GB/MB) - Mem: 15.5Gi  4.2Gi  9.8Gi  0.5Gi  1.5Gi  10.8Gi means 15.5 GB total RAM, 4.2 GB used, 9.8 GB free.​
For storage information (disks and partitions), lsblk provides a clear tree view of all storage devices - e.g., /dev/sda (main SSD) with partitions /dev/sda1 (boot) and /dev/sda2 (root), and /dev/sdb (external HDD). To see filesystem types (e.g., ext4, NTFS) and disk usage, use df -h - this shows how much space is used on each mounted partition (e.g., /dev/sda2  450Gi  120Gi  300Gi  29% / means the root partition has 450 GB total, 120 GB used, 29% utilization).​
Viewing running services and network status helps you verify if essential tools (like SSH or web servers) are active. As covered earlier, systemctl list-units --type=service lists all running services, but systemctl is-active servicename gives a quick yes/no check - systemctl is-active sshd returns active if SSH is running, inactive otherwise. For network info, ip addr shows all network interfaces (e.g., eth0 for wired, wlan0 for Wi-Fi) and their IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6). To check network connectivity to a remote server, ping -c 4 google.com sends 4 ICMP packets to Google - success means the network is working, failure indicates a connectivity issue.​
Other useful system info commands include:​
hostname: Shows the system's hostname (useful for remote connections).​
who: Lists currently logged-in users (e.g., alice pts/0  2024-05-20 10:00 (192.168.1.5)).​
uptime: Displays how long the system has been running (e.g., 12:30:00 up 2 days, 4 hours,  2 users,  load average: 0.50, 0.30, 0.20 - load average shows system busy-ness over 1, 5, 15 minutes).​
Common scenarios for checking system info include:​
Verifying if your system has enough RAM to run a resource-heavy app (use free -h).​
Troubleshooting a network issue (check ip addr for correct IP, ping for connectivity).​
Confirming the OS version before installing software (use lsb_release -a or cat /etc/os-release).​
In summary, Linux's built-in system info tools let you quickly access critical hardware, OS, and network details. By mastering commands like lscpu, free -h, df -h, and ip addr, you can diagnose issues, validate configurations, and understand your system's capabilities - all without leaving the command line.
