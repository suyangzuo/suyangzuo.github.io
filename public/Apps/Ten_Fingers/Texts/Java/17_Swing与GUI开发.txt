For building desktop graphical user interfaces, Java originally provided the Swing toolkit. Swing is a platform-independent, lightweight widget toolkit that offers a rich set of components like buttons, text fields, and tables. It is built on top of the older AWT but provides more sophisticated and customizable components. While modern Java desktop development has seen the rise of other frameworks like JavaFX, Swing remains a significant part of Java's history and is still used in many legacy applications. It demonstrated Java's capability to create complex client-side applications that could maintain a consistent look and feel across different operating systems.
