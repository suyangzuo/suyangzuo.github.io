Electron has revolutionized desktop application development by letting developers build cross-platform apps (Windows, macOS, Linux) using web technologies they already know - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Unlike traditional desktop app frameworks that require learning platform-specific languages (like C# for Windows or Swift for macOS), Electron wraps a web view (based on Chromium) and Node.js into a single package, enabling seamless integration of web UIs with native system features. This article walks through the basics of Electron development, from setting up the development environment to creating a simple functional app.​
The first step in Electron development is setting up the required tools. Since Electron relies on Node.js for backend functionality and package management, you'll need to install Node.js (which includes the npm package manager) first. Download the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version of Node.js from its official website - LTS versions are more stable and recommended for production projects. Once Node.js is installed, verify the installation by running commands in your terminal: "node -v" checks the Node.js version, and "npm -v" checks the npm version. These commands should return valid version numbers, confirming that the tools are ready to use.​
Next, create a new project folder for your Electron app and initialize it with npm. Open your terminal, navigate to the folder you want to use, and run "npm init -y" - the "-y" flag automatically answers "yes" to all prompts, creating a package.json file. This file is critical for Electron projects: it stores metadata about the app (like name, version, and author) and lists dependencies (including Electron itself). After initializing the project, install Electron as a development dependency with "npm install electron --save-dev". The "--save-dev" flag marks Electron as a development-only dependency, since it's only needed during development and will be bundled into the final app package later.​
With the environment set up, you'll need to create three core files that every Electron app requires: the main process file, the renderer process file, and an HTML file for the UI. The main process is responsible for managing native system interactions (like creating windows, handling menus, or accessing the file system) and is controlled by a JavaScript file (typically named main.js). The renderer process runs the web UI, loading an HTML file that includes your app's frontend code (CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity).​
In the main process file, you'll use Electron's built-in modules to create a browser window. Electron provides modules like BrowserWindow (for creating and managing windows) and app (for controlling the app's lifecycle). For example, you'll use app.whenReady() to wait for the app to finish initializing, then create a new BrowserWindow instance with options like width, height, and whether the window is resizable. You'll also load the HTML file into the window using the loadFile() method, which points to your UI's HTML file.​
The HTML file (often named index.html) serves as the app's frontend. It's structured like any standard web page: a head section for CSS styles and a body section for UI elements (like buttons, text inputs, or images). You can link external CSS files for styling or include inline styles, and add JavaScript files (the renderer process) to handle user interactions - like responding to button clicks or updating the UI dynamically. Since the renderer process has access to Node.js APIs (if enabled in the main process), you can also add functionality like reading from or writing to the local file system directly from the frontend code.​
Testing your Electron app is straightforward. Add a "start" script to the package.json file that runs Electron with your main process file - for example, adding "start": "electron ." to the "scripts" section. Running "npm start" in the terminal will launch your app, opening a window with your HTML UI. During testing, you can use Chrome DevTools (built into Electron) to debug the renderer process - right-click inside the app window and select "Inspect" to open DevTools, where you can debug JavaScript, inspect HTML elements, and check network requests, just like in a web browser.​
Once your app is functional, the next step is packaging it into a native desktop app for distribution. Electron provides tools like Electron Packager and Electron Builder to simplify this process. Electron Builder is more feature-rich, supporting automatic updates, code signing, and packaging for multiple platforms from a single machine. To use Electron Builder, install it as a dependency with "npm install electron-builder --save-dev", then add a "package" script to package.json (e.g., "package": "electron-builder"). Running "npm run package" will generate a native app package in a "dist" folder - for example, a .exe file for Windows, a .dmg file for macOS, or a .deb file for Linux.​
Common challenges for beginners include understanding the difference between the main and renderer processes (and how they communicate) and managing Node.js API access in the renderer process. Electron uses IPC (Inter-Process Communication) to let the main and renderer processes exchange data - for example, if the renderer process needs to access a native system feature (like the desktop notification API), it sends a request to the main process via IPC, and the main process handles the request and sends back a response. It's also important to note that enabling Node.js in the renderer process can introduce security risks, so it's recommended to use context isolation (a feature that separates the renderer process from Node.js APIs) for production apps.​
In short, Electron lowers the barrier to entry for desktop app development by leveraging web technologies. By setting up the Node.js environment, creating core main and renderer process files, testing with DevTools, and packaging with tools like Electron Builder, you can create functional cross-platform desktop apps without learning new programming languages. Whether you're building a simple note-taking app or a complex productivity tool, Electron provides the tools to turn your web skills into desktop software.
