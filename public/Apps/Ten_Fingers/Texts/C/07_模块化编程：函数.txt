Functions are the fundamental building blocks that promote modularity and code reusability in C. A function is a self-contained block of code designed to perform a specific, well-defined task. Think of them as subroutines or mini-programs within your main program. Using functions helps avoid code duplication, makes programs easier to read, debug, and maintain. To use a function, you must first declare it, typically in a header file or at the top of the source file, providing its prototype: its return type, name, and the types of its parameters. The definition of the function contains the actual body of code that is executed when the function is called. When the main function or another function invokes a subroutine by its name, along with the required arguments, the program's control flow jumps to that function's code. Once the function completes its task, it can return a value back to the caller using the return statement, and control is transferred back to the point of invocation. This process of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable functions is a cornerstone of structured programming, a paradigm that C was instrumental in popularizing.
