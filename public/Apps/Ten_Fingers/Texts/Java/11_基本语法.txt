The basic syntax of Java is designed to be clean and familiar to programmers with a C or C++ background, but with fewer complex features. A simple Java program to print "Hello, World!" consists of a class definition, a main method, and a print statement. The public keyword is an access modifier. class declares a new class named HelloWorld. The public static void main(String[] args) method is the application's entry point. The static keyword means the method belongs to the class itself rather than to instances. void indicates it returns no value. System.out.println is the statement that outputs the text to the console.
