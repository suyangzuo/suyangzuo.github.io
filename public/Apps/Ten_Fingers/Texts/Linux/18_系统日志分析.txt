System logs are a detailed record of Linux system activities - from service startups and user logins to error messages and hardware issues. Analyzing these logs is key to troubleshooting problems (like a failed web server or unexpected shutdown) and understanding how your system operates. Linux stores logs in standardized locations and provides tools to filter, search, and interpret log data. This article covers where to find key logs, how to analyze them, and common scenarios for log-based troubleshooting.​
Most Linux logs are stored in the /var/log/ directory, a centralized location for system and application logs. Key log files here include:​
syslog: General system messages, including service status updates, non-critical errors, and process activity. It captures events from most system components, making it a starting point for broad troubleshooting.​
auth.log (Debian/Ubuntu) or secure (RHEL/Fedora): Logs authentication events - like user logins (local or via SSH), sudo usage, and password changes. This is critical for detecting unauthorized access attempts (e.g., repeated failed login attempts).​
kern.log: Records kernel-related events, such as hardware detection, driver issues, and disk errors. If your system has hardware problems (like a failing hard drive or unrecognized USB device), this log will have relevant details.​
nginx/ or apache2/ (subdirectories): Application-specific logs for web servers - access logs track incoming requests (e.g., which IP accessed which page) and error logs record issues like broken links or server crashes.​
To view log files, basic command-line tools like cat, tail, and grep are essential. The cat command prints the entire contents of a log file (best for small logs or when you need to review all entries). For example, viewing the auth log with sudo cat /var/log/auth.log lets you check recent login activity. For large logs (like syslog, which can grow quickly), tail is more useful - it shows only the most recent lines. Running sudo tail -20 /var/log/syslog displays the last 20 entries of the system log, helping you focus on recent events. Adding the -f option (e.g., sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log) keeps the log open and shows new entries in real time - ideal for monitoring live issues (like a web server throwing errors as users access it).​
Filtering logs to find specific information uses the grep command, which searches for keywords or patterns. For example, to find all SSH-related entries in the auth log, run sudo grep "sshd" /var/log/auth.log (sshd is the name of the SSH service). To spot failed login attempts, use sudo grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log - this highlights lines where someone entered an incorrect password, helping you detect brute-force attacks. For case-insensitive searches (e.g., finding both "Error" and "error"), add the -i option: sudo grep -i "error" /var/log/kern.log.​
Interpreting log entries requires understanding their structure - most logs include a timestamp (when the event occurred), the hostname (which system generated the log), the service or process name (e.g., sshd, nginx), and the event details. For example, an entry like May 22 14:30:00 my-server sshd[1234]: Accepted publickey for alice from 192.168.1.5 port 56789 ssh2 tells you that on May 22 at 2:30 PM, user alice successfully logged into "my-server" via SSH from IP 192.168.1.5 using a public key.​
Common log analysis scenarios include:​
Troubleshooting a failed Nginx server: Check nginx/error.log for entries like "address already in use" (indicating another service is using port 80/443) or "invalid config" (pointing to a syntax error in the Nginx config file).​
Investigating a system crash: Review syslog and kern.log for entries just before the crash - look for keywords like "OOM killer" (out of memory, meaning the system ran out of RAM) or "hard disk error" (indicating hardware failure).​
Verifying user activity: Use auth.log to confirm which users logged in, when, and from which IP - useful for auditing or tracking who made changes to the system.​
In short, Linux system logs are a critical troubleshooting tool. By knowing where to find key logs, using cat, tail, and grep to view and filter them, and interpreting log entry details, you can quickly diagnose issues and keep your system running smoothly.
