In the annals of computer science, Bell Labs of the 1970s was undeniably a holy ground aglow with the light of genius. It was here that two remarkable figures - Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie - together sparked a computing revolution whose impact would ripple for decades. The story began with a project called "Multics." After Bell Labs withdrew from it, Ken Thompson still dreamed of building a new operating system that would make programming easier. On an idle PDP-7 machine he quietly wrote a tiny, elegant prototype OS and, half in jest, dubbed it "UNIX."
At first UNIX was written in assembly language, a tongue tightly wed to one particular machine and therefore almost impossible to move elsewhere. To escape that prison Thompson fashioned a high-level language of his own, christened "B." Yet B - essentially a leaner BCPL - was too spare to exploit the richer powers of newer hardware like the PDP-11, especially its byte-addressed memory.
Enter Dennis Ritchie. Deciding to rebuild B from the ground up, he set himself a seemingly contradictory goal: the new language had to be high-level enough to hide the machine, letting programmers think in logic, yet low-level enough to touch individual bytes and control devices with assembly-like efficiency. The result was the language that simply took the next letter of the alphabet - C. Between 1972 and 1973 Ritchie rewrote the UNIX kernel in this new tongue. That single act was epoch-making: by recompiling its C source, UNIX could now stride from one machine to another almost effortlessly. C and UNIX became symbiotic partners, each propelling the other into a new era. For this, Dennis Ritchie is honored as the father of both C and UNIX, his work laying the bedrock upon which the modern software industry still stands.
