Java is renowned for its core principle: "Write Once, Run Anywhere." This magic is achieved through the Java Virtual Machine. Unlike languages that compile directly to native machine code, the Java compiler converts source code into an intermediate format called bytecode. This bytecode is then executed by the JVM, which is specific to each underlying operating system and hardware platform. The JVM acts as a virtual computer, interpreting the bytecode or using a Just-In-Time compiler to translate it into native machine code on the fly. This abstraction layer means that as long as a JVM exists for a platform, any Java program can run on it without modification. This architecture was revolutionary and remains a key reason for Java's dominance in enterprise and cross-platform environments.
