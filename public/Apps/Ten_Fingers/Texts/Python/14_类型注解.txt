Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning variable types are determined at runtime. While this offers flexibility, it can make large codebases harder to understand and maintain, as it's not always clear what type of data a function expects or returns. Type annotations (or type hints) address this by allowing you to optionally specify the expected types of variables, function parameters, and return values.
The syntax is straightforward. For a function, you annotate its parameters and return value using a colon and the -> operator. For example: def greet(name: str) -> str: return f"Hello, {name}". This clearly indicates that the greet function expects a string and returns a string. You can annotate variables as well: count: int = 0. These annotations are stored in the __annotations__ attribute of the function and do not affect runtime behavior at all - Python remains a dynamic language.
The primary benefit is for development tools and the developer. IDEs can use type hints to provide better autocompletion, error detection, and refactoring support. Static type checkers like mypy can analyze your code without running it to find potential type-related bugs. You can annotate complex types using the typing module, which provides tools like List, Dict, Optional, and Union to describe lists of a specific type, dictionaries with specific key-value types, values that can be None, and values that can be one of several types, respectively. Adopting type hints is a best practice that significantly improves code clarity, reliability, and maintainability, especially in collaborative projects.
