The concept of separate compilation is a key to managing large C projects. It allows a program to be split into multiple source files, which can be compiled independently into object files and then linked together to form the final executable. This offers significant advantages: it reduces compilation time, as only modified files need to be recompiled, and it promotes modularity, allowing different teams to work on different parts of a project. Header files (.h) play a central role in this process. A header file typically contains declarations - function prototypes, struct definitions, macro definitions, and extern variable declarations - that are needed by other source files. The corresponding source file (.c) contains the definitions of those functions and variables. This separation of interface (the header) from implementation (the source) is a fundamental principle of software engineering in C. The build process, often managed by tools like make, orchestrates the compilation and linking of all these separate modules into a cohesive whole.
