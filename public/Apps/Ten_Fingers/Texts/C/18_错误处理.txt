Error handling in C is predominantly manual and relies on the programmer's diligence, as the language lacks built-in exception handling mechanisms found in modern languages. Most library functions indicate an error by returning a special value. For example, the malloc function returns a NULL pointer if it fails to allocate the requested memory. Similarly, fopen returns NULL if it cannot open the specified file. It is the programmer's responsibility to check these return values after every call that might fail. The global variable errno, declared in errno.h, is often set by system and library calls to a specific error code when a failure occurs. Functions like perror or strerror can then be used to convert this numeric code into a human-readable error message. A robust C program is characterized by its defensive programming style, where every operation that can potentially fail is checked, and appropriate action is taken - whether it's logging the error, attempting a recovery, or gracefully shutting down the program. This proactive approach is critical for building stable and reliable software.
