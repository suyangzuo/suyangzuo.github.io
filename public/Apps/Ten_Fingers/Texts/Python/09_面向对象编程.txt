Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses "objects" to model real-world things. Python is a multi-paradigm language, but it has strong support for OOP. The two central concepts are classes and objects.
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from it will have. For example, you could have a Dog class. This class would define that all dogs have attributes like name, age, and breed, and methods like bark() and sleep(). An object is a specific instance of a class. So, while Dog is the blueprint, my_dog = Dog("Fido", 5, "Labrador") is an actual object, an instance of the Dog class.
One of the most powerful features of OOP is inheritance. This allows you to create a new class (a child class) that inherits all the attributes and methods from an existing class (the parent class). You can then add new methods or override existing ones. For example, you could create a Poodle class that inherits from Dog and adds a unique do_trick() method. Other key OOP concepts in Python include encapsulation (bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit and restricting direct access to some of the object's components, often using private variables with a leading underscore) and polymorphism (the ability to use a common interface for different underlying forms, allowing methods to do different things based on the object that is acting upon them). OOP helps in writing modular, reusable, and maintainable code.
