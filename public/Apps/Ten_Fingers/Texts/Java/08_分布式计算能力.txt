Java's extensive networking capabilities make it an ideal platform for building distributed applications. The core Java API includes classes that simplify network communication. It provides high-level support for working with TCP/IP and UDP protocols, allowing programs to easily create socket connections and communicate over the network. This facilitates the development of client-server architectures. Moreover, technologies like Java RMI enable distributed object-oriented computing, where an object running in one JVM can invoke methods on an object located in another JVM, often on a different physical host. This innate support for networking is a key reason for Java's long-standing success in enterprise and web applications.
