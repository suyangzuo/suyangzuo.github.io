The Document Object Model represents HTML and XML documents as a tree of nodes that JavaScript can manipulate. Each element, attribute, and piece of text is a node with properties and methods. Selecting elements is done with getElementById, querySelector, querySelectorAll, getElementsByClassName, or getElementsByTagName. Creating new elements involves document.createElement, setting textContent or innerHTML, and appending with appendChild, insertBefore, or the newer after and before. Removing nodes requires removeChild or Element.remove(). Attributes and styles can be changed via setAttribute, classList.add/remove/toggle, or direct property assignment such as element.style.color = 'red'. Event listeners are added with addEventListener(type, handler, options) and removed with removeEventListener if a reference to the handler is kept. Reflow and repaint are expensive, so batch DOM updates using DocumentFragment or hide elements off-screen before making multiple changes. Understanding the difference between live HTMLCollections and static NodeLists prevents infinite loops when modifying collections during iteration. Modern frameworks abstract many of these operations, but knowing the underlying API is essential for debugging and for writing lightweight scripts without dependencies.
