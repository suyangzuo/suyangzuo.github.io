For building large-scale, distributed enterprise applications, Java EE provided a standardized, modular set of specifications. While Java EE is now maintained under the Eclipse Foundation as Jakarta EE, its principles remain influential. It defines APIs for web services, transaction management, persistence, and more. In parallel, the Spring Framework emerged as a dominant and comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java. Spring simplifies enterprise development by providing infrastructure support for dependency injection, transaction management, and data access. It offers a cohesive framework for building everything from simple web apps to complex microservices architectures.
