File permissions are a core security feature of Linux, controlling which users can read, write, or execute files and directories. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data - like system files or personal documents - and ensures only trusted users can modify critical resources. Understanding how Linux permissions work and how to adjust them is essential for keeping your system secure. This article breaks down permission basics, how to view permissions, and how to modify them for different scenarios.​
Linux permissions are based on three user types: the owner (the user who created the file), the group (a set of users with shared access), and others (all other users on the system). For each user type, there are three possible permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x). Read permission lets a user view the file's content or list a directory's contents. Write permission lets a user modify the file (edit, delete, or rename) or add/remove files in a directory. Execute permission lets a user run a file (like a script or program) or access a directory's contents (to navigate into it).​
To view file permissions, use the ls -l command (mentioned earlier for detailed file lists). The output's first column shows the permission string - for example, -rwxr-xr-- for a file or drwxr-xr-x for a directory. The first character indicates the type: - for a regular file, d for a directory. The next nine characters are split into three groups of three, representing owner, group, and others permissions. In -rwxr-xr--, the owner has read, write, and execute (rwx), the group has read and execute (r-x), and others have only read (r--).​
Modifying permissions uses the chmod command (short for "change mode"). You can use either symbolic mode (using letters like r, w, x) or numeric mode (using numbers 0-7, where each number represents a combination of permissions). Symbolic mode is more intuitive for beginners: use u for owner, g for group, o for others, a for all users; + to add a permission, - to remove it, = to set exact permissions. For example, chmod u+x script.sh adds execute permission for the owner of script.sh. chmod go-w document.txt removes write permission for group and others from document.txt.​
Numeric mode uses a three-digit number (one for each user type), where each digit is the sum of 4 (read), 2 (write), and 1 (execute). For example, 7 means rwx (4+2+1), 5 means r-x (4+1), 4 means r-- (4). To set permissions to -rwxr-xr-- numerically, use chmod 754 file.txt (owner:7, group:5, others:4). This is faster for experienced users but requires memorizing the number combinations.​
Changing the owner or group of a file uses chown (change owner) and chgrp (change group) commands. The chown command takes the new owner (and optional new group) as arguments: sudo chown alice file.txt changes the owner of file.txt to alice. sudo chown alice:team file.txt changes the owner to alice and the group to team. The chgrp command changes only the group: sudo chgrp team project folder changes the group of project folder to team. Note that you need sudo privileges to change ownership of files you don't own.​
Common permission scenarios include securing sensitive files (set others to no access with chmod o-rwx private.doc), making a script executable (add execute permission with chmod u+x myscript.sh), and sharing a directory with a team (set group to the team and give group write access with chmod g+w shared-folder). Always follow the principle of least privilege: give users only the permissions they need, no more. For example, don't give execute permission to a text file, and don't let others write to system files.​
In short, Linux file permissions are a key part of system security. By understanding how to view and modify permissions with ls -l, chmod, chown, and chgrp, you can protect your data and ensure your system runs safely. Whether you're managing personal files or a server, proper permission setup prevents unauthorized access and data loss.
