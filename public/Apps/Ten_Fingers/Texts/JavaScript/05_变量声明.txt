Before ES2015 the only way to declare a variable in JavaScript was the var statement. var is function-scoped, meaning that a variable exists throughout the entire function in which it is declared, regardless of block boundaries. It is also subject to hoisting: the declaration is moved to the top of its scope during compilation, but the assignment stays in place, often leading to undefined values when variables are accessed before they are initialized. In addition, var allows redeclaration within the same scope, which can mask typos and create subtle bugs. To address these issues ECMAScript 2015 introduced two new keywords: let and const. Both are block-scoped, so they exist only within the nearest pair of curly braces, making code more predictable and mirroring the behavior of variables in other C-family languages. let permits reassignment, while const creates a read-only reference to a value. Importantly, const does not make the value itself immutable; if the variable holds an object or an array, its properties or elements can still be modified. The temporal dead zone is another subtle feature: accessing a let or const variable before its declaration results in a ReferenceError, preventing the accidental use of hoisted but uninitialized variables. Modern style guides recommend using const by default, changing to let only when reassignment is necessary, and avoiding var altogether. This simple discipline eliminates entire classes of runtime errors and makes intent explicit to future readers of the code. Tools such as ESLint can enforce the rule automatically, and transpilers like Babel will happily convert modern syntax into var-based equivalents for older engines. Understanding the scope and lifecycle differences between var, let, and const is therefore not just academic; it is the foundation for writing maintainable large-scale JavaScript applications.
