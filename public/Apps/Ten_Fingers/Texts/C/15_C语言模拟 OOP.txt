While C does not have built-in support for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) like C++ or Java, its features can be used to approximate some OOP concepts. This demonstrates the language's flexibility. For example, data encapsulation can be simulated by using structures to group data and then using functions that operate specifically on those structures. By carefully managing the scope of variables and functions (using the static keyword), you can hide implementation details, creating a form of a private interface. While C does not have inheritance, a form of it can be achieved through composition - embedding a structure inside another structure. Polymorphism can be crudely mimicked using function pointers, which are variables that can store the address of a function. By storing different function pointers in a structure, you can change the behavior of a function call at runtime. Although these techniques are more verbose and lack the syntactic sugar of true OOP languages, they are foundational patterns used in many large-scale C projects, such as the Linux kernel, to create well-organized and maintainable systems software.
