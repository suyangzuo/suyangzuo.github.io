Web browsers provide two simple key-value stores that survive page reloads, offering a convenient way to persist data on the client. localStorage persists until explicitly cleared by JavaScript or the user, while sessionStorage is scoped to the tab and cleared when the tab is closed. Both store strings only, so objects and arrays must be serialized with JSON.stringify and deserialized with JSON.parse. The API includes setItem(key, value), getItem(key), removeItem(key), and clear(). Storage events fire on other tabs or windows when data changes, enabling cross-tab communication for features like shared login state. Quotas are typically 5–10 MB per origin; exceeding the limit throws a QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR exception. Data is accessible via JavaScript and is never sent to the server automatically, so avoid storing sensitive tokens without encryption. For larger or structured data, consider IndexedDB for transactional, indexed storage, or the Cache API for HTTP response caching. Use feature detection if your audience includes legacy browsers or private browsing modes that may disable storage. Always wrap JSON parsing in try/catch to handle corrupted data gracefully.
