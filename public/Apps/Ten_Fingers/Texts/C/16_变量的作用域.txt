The concept of scope and lifetime determines where in a program a variable can be accessed and how long it persists in memory. A variable's scope can be either block scope or file scope. A variable declared inside a function or a block {} has block scope; it is only accessible from within that block and ceases to exist when the block is exited. A variable declared outside all functions, typically at the top of a file, has file scope and is global, meaning it can be accessed by any function within that file from the point of its declaration onward. The lifetime of a variable refers to the duration for which it occupies memory. Variables with automatic storage duration, like local variables, are created when their block is entered and destroyed when it is exited. Variables with static storage duration, declared with the static keyword, persist for the entire lifetime of the program, even if they have block scope. Understanding these rules is crucial for managing data correctly and avoiding bugs related to dangling pointers or unintended data sharing.
