Electron's ecosystem is rich with tools and plugins that simplify development, from debugging and testing to packaging and deployment. These tools solve common pain points - like slow packaging, complex debugging, or tedious UI setup - letting you focus on building your app's core features instead of managing workflows. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, leveraging these tools can drastically speed up your Electron project.​
First, debugging tools are essential for fixing issues in both main and renderer processes. Chrome DevTools is built into Electron, but it only covers the renderer process. For the main process (which runs Node.js), use electron-debug - a plugin that adds main process debugging support. Install it with npm install electron-debug --save-dev, then require it in your main process: it enables main process DevTools (accessible via Ctrl+Shift+I) and adds shortcuts for reloading the app (Ctrl+R) or opening DevTools (F12). For end-to-end testing, Spectron (maintained by the Electron team) is the go-to tool - it uses WebdriverIO to automate testing of Electron apps, letting you simulate user actions (clicking buttons, typing text) and verify UI behavior. For example, you can write a test to check if the app's main window opens correctly or if a file save dialog works as expected.​
Packaging and deployment tools save time on building OS-specific binaries. While Electron has built-in packaging tools, Electron Builder is more powerful and user-friendly. It supports automatic updates, code signing, and packaging for Windows, macOS, and Linux with minimal config. You can define packaging settings in package.json - for example, specifying icon paths, target formats (EXE, DMG, DEB), and output directories. It also integrates with cloud storage (like AWS S3 or GitHub Releases) to auto-upload packaged apps, making deployment easier. Another useful tool is electron-updater, which works with Electron Builder to add automatic updates to your app - users get notified of new versions and can update without downloading the entire app again. This is critical for maintaining apps post-launch, as it lets you push bug fixes and features quickly.​
UI frameworks and components help build native-like interfaces without starting from scratch. Electron apps use web UIs, so popular web frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte work seamlessly - but you'll need tools to integrate them. create-electron-app (similar to Create React App) sets up a new Electron project with your choice of framework (React, Vue, etc.) and configures build tools (Webpack, Vite) automatically. For pre-built UI components that match native OS styles, Electron UI Kits like Fluent UI (for Windows) or macOS UI (for macOS) provide buttons, menus, and dialogs that look and feel native. These kits save time on styling and ensure your UI aligns with platform guidelines - no need to write custom CSS for every OS.​
Logging and error tracking tools help diagnose issues in production. electron-log is a simple logging library that works in both main and renderer processes - it logs to files (in the app's user data directory) and can send logs to remote services (like Loggly or Datadog). This is invaluable for debugging issues that only occur in production, as users can send logs to you for analysis. For error tracking, Sentry integrates with Electron to capture crashes and unhandled exceptions - when an error occurs, Sentry sends details (stack trace, OS version, app version) to your dashboard, letting you fix issues quickly. It also supports user feedback, so users can describe what they were doing when the error happened.​
Performance monitoring tools help keep your app fast. electron-performance-monitor adds a overlay to your app that shows real-time CPU, memory, and network usage - useful during development to spot performance bottlenecks (like a memory leak or a CPU-heavy task). For production, New Relic or Datadog offer Electron-specific monitoring, tracking metrics like startup time, window load time, and user interactions. These tools alert you to performance issues (e.g., slow startup on Windows 10) and help you prioritize optimizations.​
Dependency management tools ensure your project stays secure and up to date. npm audit scans for vulnerable dependencies, but snyk goes further - it integrates with your CI/CD pipeline to block builds with high-severity vulnerabilities and suggests fixes. depcheck helps clean up unused dependencies, reducing your app's size and load time. For managing Electron versions, electron-releases tracks the latest stable and beta versions, so you can stay informed about updates and security patches.​
In short, Electron's ecosystem has tools for every stage of development - debugging, testing, packaging, UI design, logging, and performance. By integrating these tools into your workflow, you can reduce repetitive work, catch issues early, and build higher-quality Electron apps faster. You don't need to use all of them - pick the ones that solve your specific pain points, whether that's faster packaging or easier debugging.
