Installing, updating, and removing software on Linux is handled by package managers - tools that automate the process of downloading, configuring, and managing software packages. The two most common package managers are APT (Advanced Package Tool) used by Debian-based distributions (like Ubuntu, Linux Mint) and DNF (Dandified YUM) used by RHEL-based distributions (like Fedora, CentOS Stream). Understanding how to use these tools lets you keep your system's software up-to-date and install new apps easily. This article covers the basic commands for APT and DNF.​
For Debian-based systems (APT), the first step before installing or updating software is to refresh the package list - this ensures your system has the latest information about available packages and their versions. Use sudo apt update to update the package list; this command connects to Linux repositories (servers hosting software packages) and downloads the latest package metadata. It doesn't install or update any software, just updates the list of what's available.​
To install a software package with APT, use sudo apt install packagename. For example, sudo apt install firefox installs the Firefox browser, and sudo apt install mysql-server installs the MySQL database server. APT will automatically download the package and any required dependencies (other software the package needs to run) and prompt you to confirm before installing (press Y to proceed).​
Updating all installed software to the latest versions uses sudo apt upgrade - this command checks which installed packages have updates available (using the list from apt update) and installs them. It will prompt you to confirm the download size and installation; press Y to continue. For a more thorough update that handles package removals or additions (e.g., replacing old packages with new ones), use sudo apt full-upgrade - this is useful for major system updates but should be used with caution, as it may remove conflicting packages.​
Removing software with APT has two options: sudo apt remove packagename removes the package but leaves configuration files (useful if you plan to reinstall the package later), and sudo apt purge packagename removes the package and all its configuration files (use this if you want to fully uninstall the software). For example, sudo apt purge mysql-server completely removes MySQL and its config files. To clean up unused dependencies (packages installed to support other software that's now removed), use sudo apt autoremove - this frees up disk space by deleting unnecessary packages.​
For RHEL-based systems (DNF), the basic commands are similar but use dnf instead of apt. To refresh the package list, use sudo dnf check-update (this shows available updates without downloading them) or sudo dnf updateinfo for detailed update information. To update the package list and install all available updates in one step, use sudo dnf upgrade - DNF automatically refreshes the package list before upgrading, so there's no need for a separate "update" command like APT.​
Installing a package with DNF uses sudo dnf install packagename - e.g., sudo dnf install chromium installs the Chromium browser. DNF, like APT, resolves dependencies automatically and prompts for confirmation. Removing a package uses sudo dnf remove packagename (removes the package but leaves configs) or sudo dnf erase packagename (same as remove). To remove unused dependencies, use sudo dnf autoremove - DNF also has sudo dnf clean all to clear cached package files, freeing up disk space.​
Searching for packages is useful when you don't know the exact package name. With APT, use apt search keyword - e.g., apt search text editor lists all packages related to text editors. With DNF, use dnf search keyword - dnf search image viewer finds image viewer packages. To get detailed information about a package (like its description, version, and dependencies), use apt show packagename (APT) or dnf info packagename (DNF).​
Common software management scenarios include installing essential apps (browsers, text editors), updating the system for security patches (run sudo apt upgrade or sudo dnf upgrade regularly), and removing unused software to free space. Always use the official package manager for your distribution instead of downloading random binaries from the internet - this ensures software is tested for compatibility and security.​
In summary, APT and DNF are user-friendly package managers that simplify software management on Linux. By mastering basic commands for updating, installing, and removing packages, you can keep your system running smoothly and access the software you need. Whether you use a Debian-based or RHEL-based distribution, these tools are essential for daily Linux use.
