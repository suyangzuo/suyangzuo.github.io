A memory leak in production never announces itself politely. One moment your Node.js service hums along, the next RSS graphs climb like a rocket. Start by teaching ops a one-liner: send USR2 to the process, trigger heapdump write, then download the snapshot. Open Chrome DevTools, sort retained size, and the culprit object path lights up like a Christmas tree. Nine times out of ten it is event listeners forgotten after hot reload, or a cache without TTL. Fix, redeploy, snapshot again - if the stair-step line flattens, you have earned your coffee.
