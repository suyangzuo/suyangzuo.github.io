Node.js v25, released in October 2025, marks a significant milestone in the runtime's evolution. This version introduces a host of new features and improvements that enhance performance, security, and developer experience.
Enhanced V8 Engine
Node.js v25 ships with V8 14.1, delivering substantial performance improvements. Notably, JSON.stringify operations are now significantly faster, benefiting applications that heavily rely on JSON data processing. Additionally, built-in Uint8Array base64/hex conversion streamlines binary data handling.
Secure-by-Default Applications
Security remains a top priority. The new permission model introduces --allow-net flags, enabling developers to restrict network access explicitly. Web Storage is now enabled by default, and ErrorEvent is exposed globally, enhancing error handling capabilities.
WebAssembly and JIT Optimizations
Node.js v25 doubles down on WebAssembly support, offering improved runtime performance and Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation optimizations. These enhancements make Node.js a more attractive platform for compute-intensive applications.
Native Test Runner and Profiling
The built-in test runner is now stable, reducing reliance on external testing frameworks. Additionally, performance profiling tools are integrated directly into the runtime, simplifying performance analysis and optimization.
Portable Compile Cache
A new portable compile cache improves startup times by caching compiled JavaScript code. This feature is particularly beneficial for serverless environments where fast cold starts are crucial.
Removed Deprecated APIs
To maintain a clean and efficient API surface, long-deprecated features like SlowBuffer have been removed. This streamlining reduces complexity and encourages developers to adopt modern alternatives.
In summary, Node.js v25 represents a significant leap forward, offering developers a more secure, performant, and feature-rich environment for building modern applications.
