Proper network configuration is essential for Linux systems to connect to the internet, communicate with other devices on a local network, or serve as a server (like a web or database server). Linux supports both dynamic IP assignment (via DHCP) and static IP setup (fixed IP address), along with DNS configuration to resolve domain names to IP addresses. This article covers how to view current network settings, configure a static IP, and set up DNS servers.​
First, viewing current network configuration helps you understand your system's existing setup. The ip addr command (short for "ip address") is the primary tool - it lists all network interfaces (e.g., eth0 for wired Ethernet, wlan0 for Wi-Fi) and their assigned IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6), subnet masks, and MAC addresses. For example, a line like inet 192.168.1.10/24 brd 192.168.1.255 scope global dynamic eth0 means the eth0 interface has a dynamic IPv4 address of 192.168.1.10 with a subnet mask of /24 (255.255.255.0) and a broadcast address of 192.168.1.255.​
To check the default gateway (the router IP your system uses to access the internet), use ip route - the output line starting with default via shows the gateway, e.g., default via 192.168.1.1 dev eth0 means the default gateway is 192.168.1.1 (the router) on the eth0 interface. For DNS settings, view the /etc/resolv.conf file with cat /etc/resolv.conf - lines starting with nameserver list the DNS servers, e.g., nameserver 8.8.8.8 (Google's public DNS) or nameserver 192.168.1.1 (router's DNS).​
Configuring a static IP (instead of dynamic DHCP) is useful for servers that need a fixed address (e.g., a web server accessed via a domain name). Modern Linux distributions use NetworkManager (for desktop systems) or netplan (for Ubuntu server) for network configuration. For netplan (common on Ubuntu 18.04+), first find the configuration file in /etc/netplan/ (usually named 00-installer-config.yaml). Edit the file with sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml - replace the DHCP settings with static IP details:​
dhcp4: no (disable DHCPv4)​
addresses: [192.168.1.20/24] (static IP and subnet mask)​
gateway4: 192.168.1.1 (default gateway)​
nameservers: addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4] (DNS servers)​
Save the file (Ctrl+O, Enter) and exit (Ctrl+X), then apply the changes with sudo netplan apply. Verify the static IP with ip addr - the eth0 interface should now show the static address 192.168.1.20.​
For systems using NetworkManager (e.g., Ubuntu Desktop), you can configure static IP via the graphical interface: go to "Settings" → "Network" → select your interface → "IPv4" → set "Method" to "Manual" → enter static IP, subnet mask, gateway, and DNS servers. Click "Apply" to save changes - this is simpler for desktop users who prefer GUI tools.​
Setting up DNS servers manually ensures your system uses reliable DNS (e.g., Google DNS, Cloudflare DNS) instead of the router's default. Edit the /etc/resolv.conf file (note: on some systems, this file is managed automatically, so you may need to edit NetworkManager or netplan configs instead). Add or replace nameserver lines: nameserver 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare DNS) and nameserver 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS) are popular choices. Save the file - your system will now use these DNS servers to resolve domain names.​
Common network configuration scenarios include:​
Setting up a home server with a static IP (so other devices can always access it via the same IP).​
Fixing DNS issues (replacing a slow router DNS with public DNS like Cloudflare).​
Troubleshooting connectivity (verifying IP/gateway with ip addr/ip route to ensure settings are correct).​
In short, Linux offers flexible tools for network configuration - ip commands for viewing settings, netplan/NetworkManager for static IP setup, and /etc/resolv.conf for DNS. By mastering these, you can ensure your system connects reliably to networks and the internet.
