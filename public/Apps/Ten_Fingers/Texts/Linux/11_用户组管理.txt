Linux uses user groups to simplify permission management - instead of assigning permissions to individual users, you can assign them to a group, and all users in the group inherit those permissions. This is especially useful for team collaboration (e.g., a group of developers working on the same project) or managing access to shared resources (like a common file folder). Understanding how to create groups, add users to groups, and manage group permissions helps keep your system organized and secure. This article covers the essential commands for Linux user group management.​
First, viewing existing groups helps you understand the current system setup. The cat /etc/group command lists all groups on the system, with each line showing the group name, group password (usually x indicating no password), group ID (GID), and the users in the group. For example, a line like developers:x:1005:alice,bob means the developers group has GID 1005, and users alice and bob are members. To check which groups a specific user belongs to, use groups username - e.g., groups alice lists all groups that alice is part of, including their primary group (the default group for the user's files) and secondary groups.​
Creating a new group uses the groupadd command with sudo (since group management requires administrative privileges). sudo groupadd project-team creates a new group named project-team with an auto-assigned GID (Linux automatically assigns GIDs above 1000 for user-created groups, while system groups have lower GIDs). To specify a custom GID (useful for consistency across systems), add the -g option: sudo groupadd -g 1006 project-team creates the project-team group with GID 1006.​
Adding users to a group (making them secondary members) uses usermod -aG groupname username, where -a means "append" (add the user to the group without removing them from other groups) and -G specifies the secondary group. For example, sudo usermod -aG project-team charlie adds user charlie to the project-team group. To set a user's primary group (the group that owns the user's new files), use usermod -g groupname username - e.g., sudo usermod -g project-team charlie changes charlie's primary group to project-team (note: this doesn't remove them from secondary groups).​
Removing a user from a group uses gpasswd -d username groupname - e.g., sudo gpasswd -d charlie project-team removes charlie from the project-team group. To delete a group entirely (only possible if no users have it as their primary group), use sudo groupdel groupname - e.g., sudo groupdel old-team deletes the old-team group. If you try to delete a group that's a user's primary group, Linux will throw an error - you'll need to change the user's primary group first (with usermod -g) before deleting the group.​
Using groups for permission management is straightforward. For example, if you have a shared folder /mnt/project-files that only the project-team group should access, set the folder's group owner to project-team with sudo chgrp -R project-team /mnt/project-files (the -R option applies the change recursively to all files and subfolders). Then give the group write permission with sudo chmod -R g+w /mnt/project-files - now all members of project-team can read and write to the folder, while other users have only the permissions set for "others" (usually read-only or no access).​
Common group management scenarios include setting up a team folder for developers (all in a devs group with write access), restricting access to sensitive data (a finance group for financial files), or managing printer access (a printers group for users allowed to print). By using groups, you avoid the tedious task of updating permissions for each user individually - adding a new team member just requires adding them to the relevant group.​
In short, Linux user groups streamline permission management and support team collaboration. By mastering groupadd, usermod, and gpasswd, you can create groups, manage memberships, and control access to shared resources efficiently - keeping your system organized and secure.
