Electron's compatibility with front-end frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte lets web developers build desktop apps with familiar tools. Each framework has unique integration steps, but all require separating UI logic (renderer process) from native features (main process) to ensure security and functionality.​
For React, use create-electron-app to scaffold a pre-configured project: run npx create-electron-app electron-react-app --template react. This sets up a main process folder (for Electron logic) and a renderer folder (for React components), with Webpack for bundling and a dev server for hot reloading. Since React runs in the renderer process, it can't access Node.js APIs directly (due to context isolation). Use IPC channels to connect to native features: a React button triggering a file load, for example, sends an ipcRenderer.invoke() request to the main process, which uses the fs module to read the file and return content.​
Vue 3 integration uses create-vue (Vue's official tool) and Electron. First, create a Vue project with npm create vue@latest electron-vue-app, selecting features like TypeScript or Pinia. Install Electron as a dev dependency, then create a main process file to initialize the Electron window. During development, Vue's dev server runs on http://localhost:5173 - load this URL in the main process with win.loadURL(). For production, build Vue to a dist folder and update the main process to load dist/index.html with win.loadFile(). Keep native logic in the main process; use IPC to communicate with Vue's single-file components (SFCs).​
Svelte, a lightweight framework, integrates minimally. Create a Svelte project with npm create svelte@latest electron-svelte-app (choose "Skeleton project" for simplicity), install Electron, and add a main process file. Svelte's dev server uses http://localhost:5173 (loaded via win.loadURL() in development); build to a build folder for production, loading build/index.html in the main process. Svelte's reactivity works well with IPC: a reactive array in a Svelte component can populate with note data sent from the main process via ipcRenderer.on().​
Shared best practices apply across frameworks: enable context isolation and disable Node.js integration in the renderer process for security. Optimize builds with framework tools (e.g., vite build for Vue, svelte-kit build for Svelte) to reduce app size. Handle client-side routing (React Router, Vue Router) by configuring Electron to load index.html for 404 errors, ensuring deep links work. Test in both development and production modes to catch path or asset issues.​
For state management, use framework-specific tools (Redux for React, Pinia for Vue, Svelte Stores) and sync with the main process via IPC. Debug with framework dev tools (React DevTools, Vue DevTools) in the renderer process, combined with main process debugging via electron-debug.​
In short, integrating these frameworks with Electron lets you build desktop apps with web skills. Focus on IPC for native features, security best practices, and optimized builds to create a seamless experience.
