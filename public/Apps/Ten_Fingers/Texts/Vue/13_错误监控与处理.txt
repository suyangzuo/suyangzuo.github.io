No Vue app is perfect - errors can happen during development, testing, or production. Proper error monitoring and handling help you catch issues early, fix them quickly, and keep users from facing broken experiences. This article outlines how to handle errors in Vue apps, from local debugging to production-level monitoring.​
First, let's cover development-stage error handling. Vue provides a built-in error handler that logs errors to the browser console by default. For Vue 3, you can customize this handler using app.config.errorHandler in your main app file. This function catches errors from components, directives, event handlers, and lifecycle hooks. For example, you can set it to log errors with extra context (like the component name) or show a friendly message in development instead of a broken UI.​
During development, the Vue DevTools extension is also a big help. It lets you inspect component hierarchies and state, making it easier to trace where an error originates. For example, if a component's data property is undefined, Vue DevTools will show the component's data in real time, helping you spot the missing value.​
For production, you need more than console logs - you need a way to track errors as they happen to real users. Tools like Sentry, LogRocket, or Bugsnag integrate with Vue to capture errors, send them to a dashboard, and provide details like the user's browser, device, and the steps that led to the error. Setting up Sentry with Vue is simple: install the Sentry SDK via npm, initialize it with your project's DSN (a unique identifier from Sentry), and use the Vue integration to capture Vue-specific errors.​
In addition to third-party tools, Vue lets you add user-facing error handling. For example, you can create a global error component that shows when an unexpected error occurs - instead of a blank screen, users see a message like "Oops! Something went wrong. Please try again later." You can trigger this component using Vue's errorCaptured hook, which catches errors from child components. The errorCaptured hook lets you decide whether to propagate the error (for logging) or handle it locally (by showing the error component).​
Async error handling is another key area. In Vue components, async code (like API calls) can throw errors that aren't caught by the default error handler. Use try/catch blocks around async functions (like async mounted() or async methods) to catch these errors. For example, if an API call to fetch user data fails, you can catch the error and show a message to the user (e.g., "Failed to load user data. Please check your internet connection.").​
Finally, proactive monitoring helps you fix issues before they affect many users. Tools like Sentry let you set up alerts - for example, you'll get an email or Slack message if a new error occurs more than 10 times in an hour. This lets you respond quickly to critical issues, keeping your app reliable.​
In summary, Vue error handling involves customizing the built-in error handler for development, using third-party tools for production monitoring, adding user-facing error UI, and handling async errors with try/catch. By covering all these steps, you can ensure your Vue app is robust and user-friendly - even when errors happen.
