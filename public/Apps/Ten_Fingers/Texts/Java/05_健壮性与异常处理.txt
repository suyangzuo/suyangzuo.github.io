Java was designed to be a robust language, meaning it emphasizes early error checking and runtime stability. One key feature that contributes to this is its strong, static type system. Variables must be declared with a specific type, and the compiler performs extensive type checking to catch many errors before the program even runs. Furthermore, Java has a built-in exception handling mechanism. This provides a structured and powerful way to handle runtime errors, separating the normal program logic from the error-handling code. Using try, catch, finally, and throw keywords, developers can gracefully manage unexpected situations, preventing program crashes and ensuring reliable operation.
