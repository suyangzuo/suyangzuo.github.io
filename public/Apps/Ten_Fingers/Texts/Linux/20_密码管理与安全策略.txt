User passwords are the first line of defense for Linux system security - weak or outdated passwords can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise. Proper password management, including regular password changes, setting password complexity rules, and configuring password expiration, is essential to keep user accounts secure. This article covers how to manage user passwords, enforce security policies, and recover lost passwords on Linux systems.​
Changing a user's password is a basic but critical task. For a user to change their own password, they simply run the passwd command in the terminal - no administrative privileges are needed. The system will first prompt for the current password (to verify identity) and then ask for the new password twice (to confirm no typos). It's important to choose a strong password: at least 8 characters long, combining uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols (like !, @, #). Linux will often warn if the new password is too weak (e.g., all lowercase or a common word) and may require a stronger one before proceeding.​
To change another user's password (e.g., an administrator resetting a user's forgotten password), use the passwd command with the username and administrative privileges. For example, running sudo passwd alice lets an administrator set a new password for the user alice. The system won't ask for alice's current password (since the administrator is authorized to reset it) but will prompt twice for the new password. After resetting, it's best practice to inform the user to change the temporary password to a personal, strong one immediately - this prevents the administrator from retaining long-term access to the user's account.​
Configuring password expiration ensures users update their passwords regularly, reducing the risk of a compromised password being used indefinitely. Linux uses the chage command (short for "change age") to manage password expiration settings for a user. For example, to set a password to expire after 90 days (so the user must change it every 90 days), run sudo chage -M 90 alice - the -M option specifies the maximum number of days a password can be used. To set a grace period (days of warning before expiration), use -W: sudo chage -W 7 alice sends a warning to alice 7 days before her password expires. To force a user to change their password on the next login (e.g., after a reset), use sudo chage -d 0 alice - the -d 0 sets the last password change date to "0" (a special value that triggers an immediate password change prompt on login).​
Enforcing password complexity rules adds an extra layer of security by preventing weak passwords. Most Linux distributions use pam_cracklib (a Pluggable Authentication Module) to enforce these rules. The configuration for this is stored in /etc/pam.d/common-password (Debian/Ubuntu) or /etc/pam.d/system-auth (RHEL/Fedora). While editing this file requires caution (incorrect changes can lock users out), common rules to enable include: minimum password length (e.g., 8 characters), requirement for mixed case (uppercase and lowercase), requirement for numbers, and requirement for special symbols. For example, adding a rule to require at least one number ensures users can't set passwords like "Password" and must use something like "Password123" instead. System administrators can also use tools like libpwquality to fine-tune these rules without directly editing PAM files, making the process safer for beginners.​
Recovering a lost root password (the administrative account) is a common scenario, though it requires physical or console access to the system (remote access won't work). The process involves booting the system into "single-user mode" (a minimal mode with only basic services running) or "rescue mode." Once in this mode, the root filesystem is mounted as read-only by default - remount it as read-write with a command to allow changes. Then run passwd (without a username, since it targets root by default) to set a new root password. After saving the change, reboot the system normally - root will now be able to log in with the new password. It's critical to restrict access to single-user mode (e.g., via BIOS/UEFI password protection) to prevent unauthorized users from using this method to reset the root password.​
Common password management scenarios include:​
A user forgetting their password: An administrator resets it with sudo passwd username and forces a change on next login.​
Enforcing company security policies: Setting all users' passwords to expire every 60 days with chage -M 60 and requiring complex passwords via PAM.​
Securing a new system: Immediately changing the default root password (if the system came with one) and setting up expiration for all user accounts.​
In short, Linux provides robust tools for password management and security. By changing passwords regularly, enforcing complexity rules, configuring expiration, and securing root password recovery, you can protect user accounts and prevent unauthorized access to your Linux system.
