Lambda expressions, a flagship feature introduced in Java 8, added powerful functional programming capabilities to the language. A lambda expression is essentially an anonymous function that can be passed around as a value. It provides a clear and concise way to represent a method interface using an expression. Lambdas are primarily used to implement functional interfaces, which are interfaces with a single abstract method. This feature greatly simplified common programming patterns, especially when working with the Collections Framework and the new Streams API, enabling a more declarative and expressive style of programming.
