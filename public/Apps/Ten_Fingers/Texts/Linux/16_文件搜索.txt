Finding specific files or text within files is a common task on Linux - whether you're looking for a lost document, searching for a configuration setting, or debugging a script. Linux provides powerful command-line tools for this: find for locating files by name, size, or date; and grep for searching text within files. Understanding how to use these tools lets you find what you need quickly, even on systems with thousands of files. This article covers the basics of find and grep for file search.​
The find command searches for files and directories based on criteria like name, size, modification date, or owner. Its basic syntax is find search-path criteria action - search-path is where to search (e.g., /home for user files, / for the entire system), criteria is what to look for, and action is what to do with matching files (default is to list them).​
To find a file by name, use the -name option with a filename pattern (wildcards like * match any characters). For example, find /home -name "document.txt" searches the /home directory (and subdirectories) for a file named document.txt (case-sensitive). To make the search case-insensitive, use -iname instead: find /home -iname "Document.TXT" will find document.txt, Document.TXT, or DOCUMENT.txt.​
To find files by size, use the -size option. For example, find /var/log -size +100M searches /var/log for files larger than 100 MB (use + for "larger than," - for "smaller than," no sign for "exactly"). find ~ -size -10k finds files smaller than 10 KB in your home directory (~).​
To find files by modification date, use -mtime (modification time in days). find /home -mtime -7 finds files modified in the last 7 days ( -7 = last 7 days, +30 = more than 30 days ago). This is useful for finding recent documents or old log files to delete.​
The grep command searches for text patterns within files - it's ideal for finding a specific setting in a config file or a keyword in a log. Basic syntax: grep "search-pattern" file(s). For example, grep "Listen 80" /etc/apache2/apache2.conf searches the Apache config file for the line "Listen 80" (which defines the port Apache uses).​
To search text recursively in all files within a directory (and subdirectories), use the -r option: grep -r "ErrorLog" /etc/nginx/ searches all Nginx config files for the text "ErrorLog" (which specifies where Nginx logs errors). To make the search case-insensitive, use -i: grep -ir "error" /var/log/syslog finds "error," "Error," or "ERROR" in the system log.​
To show line numbers of matching text (helpful for editing files), use -n: grep -n "root" /etc/passwd lists lines in the passwd file (which stores user info) that contain "root," along with their line numbers. To show only the filenames that contain the search pattern (instead of the matching lines), use -l: grep -rl "database" /home/user/projects/ lists all files in the projects directory that have the word "database."​
Combining find and grep lets you narrow down searches - for example, find /home -name "*.conf" -exec grep "port" {} \; finds all .conf files in /home and searches each for the text "port." The -exec option tells find to run the grep command on each matching file ({} is a placeholder for the filename).​
Common file search scenarios include:​
Finding a lost config.ini file (use find / -name "config.ini").​
Searching log files for error messages (use grep -i "error" /var/log/*.log).​
Locating all .sh scripts modified in the last 3 days (use find ~ -name "*.sh" -mtime -3).​
In summary, find and grep are essential for file search on Linux. By using find to locate files by criteria and grep to search text within them, you can quickly find any file or content - saving time and avoiding manual browsing through directories.
