In the early 1990s the web was static. Pages arrived from the server as plain HTML and could not change once they were on the screen. Netscape Communications wanted to add life to those documents, so in 1995 they hired Brendan Eich with an unusual goal: create a scripting language that could be embedded directly into the browser and executed on the user's machine. Eich had only ten days to produce a working prototype, but he managed to deliver a language that combined the familiar curly-brace syntax of C with the functional flavor of Scheme and the loose typing of Self. The first internal name was Mocha, soon changed to LiveScript, and finally to JavaScript in order to ride the marketing wave surrounding Sun's Java. The name caused decades of confusion, yet the language itself had nothing to do with Java apart from superficial syntactic similarities. Microsoft quickly shipped its own implementation called JScript to avoid trademark issues, and the two versions diverged enough that web authors had to write code that tested for browser capabilities, spawning the term "browser sniffing." To prevent fragmentation, Netscape submitted the language specification to Ecma International in 1996, and the first ECMAScript standard was published in 1997. Since then the language has evolved through editions nicknamed ES3, ES5, ES2015 (ES6), and yearly updates that bring features like arrow functions, classes, modules, async/await, destructuring, and optional chaining. Each edition is backwards compatible, meaning old scripts continue to run, but new syntax allows developers to express ideas more safely and concisely. JavaScript escaped the browser with the release of Node.js in 2009, turning it into a general-purpose language for servers, desktop applications, mobile apps, and even microcontrollers. Today JavaScript is the most widely deployed programming language on Earth, powering everything from interactive forms to real-time video editors, from REST APIs to Mars rover simulations. Its journey from a ten-day sketch to the backbone of modern software illustrates how a minimal but flexible core, combined with an open standards process and a vibrant community, can reshape entire industries.
