pip is the standard package manager for Python. It allows you to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies that are not part of the Python standard library. The command pip install package_name downloads the package from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and installs it into your current Python environment.
While pip is great for installing packages, managing project dependencies requires a bit more structure. A common practice is to list all of a project's dependencies in a file called requirements.txt. Each line in this file specifies a package, optionally with a version number (e.g., Django==3.2.5 or requests>=2.25.0). To install all dependencies for a project, you simply run pip install -r requirements.txt. This ensures consistency across different setups (like development and production).
However, requirements.txt has limitations. It doesn't manage different versions for different environments (e.g., having separate dependencies for development and production), and it can struggle with complex dependency resolution. Modern Python development has moved towards using pyproject.toml files, as defined in PEP 518. Build tools like Poetry and Flit use this file to manage not just dependencies, but also project metadata, packaging, and publishing. Poetry, for instance, provides a lock file (poetry.lock) that pins the exact versions of all dependencies (and their dependencies), guaranteeing reproducible installs. It also handles virtual environments automatically. Whether you use pip and requirements.txt or a modern tool like Poetry, the goal is the same: to clearly define and control your project's dependencies for stability and reproducibility.
