Java is a strictly object-oriented programming language. This means that everything in Java is an object, with the exception of the primitive data types. The language is built around the concepts of classes and objects. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the state and behavior that the objects of that class will possess. An object is a specific instance of a class, created at runtime. This paradigm promotes key principles like encapsulation, which bundles data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit; inheritance, which allows new classes to be built upon existing ones; and polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
