Arrays in C provide a powerful mechanism for storing and managing collections of items of the same data type under a single identifier. Instead of declaring hundreds of individual variables, a programmer can declare one array, such as int scores[100];, which reserves a contiguous block of memory capable of holding 100 integers. Each element in the array can be accessed directly using its index, a integer value starting from zero. So, the first element is scores[0], the second is scores[1], and so on, up to the last element, scores[99]. This random access capability, facilitated by simple pointer arithmetic under the hood, is extremely efficient. Arrays are indispensable for handling lists of data, from test scores and temperature readings to character strings. In fact, strings in C are traditionally implemented as arrays of characters, terminated by a special null character '\0'. This direct, low-level representation gives programmers immense control but also places the responsibility of managing bounds correctly on them, as accessing an array outside its defined limits leads to undefined behavior, a common source of bugs.
