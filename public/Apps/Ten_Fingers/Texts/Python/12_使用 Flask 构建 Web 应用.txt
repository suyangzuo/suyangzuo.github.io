Flask is a lightweight and flexible micro web framework for Python. Its "micro" nature means it provides the essential tools for building web applications without imposing a lot of pre-defined structure or dependencies, giving the developer a great deal of freedom.
Creating a basic Flask application can be done in just a few lines of code. You create an instance of the Flask class, then use route decorators to bind functions to URLs. For example, @app.route('/') associates the root URL with the function that follows it. This function returns the HTML (or other data) that will be displayed in the user's browser. Flask can handle different HTTP methods like GET and POST, allowing you to build interactive forms.
While Flask is simple at its core, it's highly extensible. A vast ecosystem of extensions allows you to add functionality like database integration with Flask-SQLAlchemy, user authentication with Flask-Login, and form handling with Flask-WTF. Flask uses Jinja2 as its templating engine, which allows you to write HTML files with special placeholders and logic. This enables you to dynamically generate web pages by passing Python variables to the template. For example, you can have a template that displays a list of blog posts, where the posts are fetched from a database and injected into the HTML by Jinja2. Flask's built-in development server is great for testing, but for production, you would deploy your application using a robust WSGI server like Gunicorn behind a reverse proxy like Nginx. Flask's simplicity and power make it an excellent choice for building everything from simple REST APIs to complex web applications.
