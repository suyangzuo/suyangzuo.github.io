As you work on more Python projects, you'll quickly encounter a problem: different projects often require different versions of the same library. Installing everything globally can lead to version conflicts that break your applications. This is where virtual environments come to the rescue.
A virtual environment is an isolated, self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular project, along with all of its packages. This means you can have one project using Django 3.2 and another using Django 4.0 on the same machine without any conflict. The tool used to create these environments is called venv, and it's included in the standard library for Python 3.3 and above.
Creating a virtual environment is simple. You run python -m venv my_project_env in your terminal. This creates a folder (often named venv or .venv) that contains a copy of the Python interpreter and a pip for installing packages. To start using the environment, you need to "activate" it. On macOS/Linux, you run source my_project_env/bin/activate. On Windows, it's my_project_env\Scripts\activate. Once activated, your shell prompt will change to show the name of the activated environment, and any pip install commands will install packages into this isolated space, not globally. When you're done working, the deactivate command returns you to the global system environment. Using virtual environments is a fundamental best practice for Python development and dependency management.
