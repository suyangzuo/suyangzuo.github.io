Security is a fundamental aspect of the Java platform. Its architecture includes multiple layers of security features that protect against malicious code. The JVM itself acts as a security sandbox. Bytecode is verified before execution to ensure it adheres to Java's language rules and doesn't perform illegal operations. The Security Manager allows applications to establish custom security policies, restricting actions like file access or network connections for untrusted code. Furthermore, Java provides APIs for cryptography, secure communication, and authentication. This comprehensive security model has made Java a trusted choice for enterprise-level applications, especially in networked and distributed environments where security is paramount.
