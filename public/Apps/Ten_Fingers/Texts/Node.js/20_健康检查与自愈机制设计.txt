A silent service is a dead service. Bake health checks into every Node.js process so orchestrators can kill and replace containers before users notice. Expose three endpoints: /live for process vitality, /ready for dependency readiness, and /metrics for Prometheus scraping. The liveness probe returns 200 if the event loop lag is below one second; anything higher triggers a restart. The readiness probe verifies database connectivity, Redis ping, and external API tokens; fail fast during deployment to prevent half-open containers from receiving traffic. Implement graceful shutdown: intercept SIGTERM, stop accepting new sockets, wait for in-flight requests to finish, then exit with code zero - no more 502 spikes during rollouts. Finally, add a self-healing circuit breaker around critical paths: if error rate exceeds five percent within thirty seconds, open the circuit, return cached fallback, and attempt close after one minute. These small guardians turn midnight pages into morning graphs.
