The const and volatile keywords are type qualifiers that provide the compiler with additional information about how a variable should be treated. The const keyword indicates that a variable's value is read-only and should not be modified after initialization. This is a powerful tool for enforcing program correctness and intent. For example, declaring a function parameter as const promises the caller that the function will not alter its value. It can also be used to define symbolic constants that are type-safe, as an alternative to #define macros. On the other hand, volatile informs the compiler that a variable's value may change at any time, without any action being taken by the code the compiler sees. This is essential for variables that are mapped to memory-mapped hardware registers, modified by an interrupt service routine, or shared between multiple threads. It tells the compiler to disable certain optimizations, like caching the variable's value in a register, and to always reload it from memory on every access. Using these qualifiers correctly is a mark of an experienced C programmer working on robust or low-level systems.
